                    <p>KPMG just told the market what AI-augmented auditing is worth: 14% less than last year. That's not just a procurement win for one firm. It's a market signal that will ripple through every vendor relationship where audit, assurance, or professional services fees are on the table.</p>

                    <p>The implications extend well beyond KPMG's books. When a Big Four firm publicly stakes a position on what AI does to service pricing, they're creating a reference point that procurement teams everywhere will use. And that creates pressure that cuts in directions nobody's fully mapped out yet.</p>

                    <h2>The News</h2>

                    <p>KPMG International negotiated a 14% fee reduction from its auditor, Grant Thornton UK, for its 2025 audit. The argument: AI makes audit work cheaper, so pass on the savings.</p>

                    <p>The fee dropped from $416,000 to $357,000. KPMG threatened to switch auditors if Grant Thornton didn't comply.</p>

                    <p>This was filed at UK Companies House. Public record. Anyone can see it.</p>

                    <h2>Why This Isn't Just a Procurement Win</h2>

                    <p>KPMG didn't just negotiate a discount. They filed a valuation.</p>

                    <p>Every CFO and procurement team now has a market reference price—a comp—for what a Big Four firm believes AI-assisted audit services are worth. And it's 14% lower than last year, during a period when audit fees have been <em>rising</em> across Europe as firms invest in AI infrastructure.</p>

                    <p>That's not a negotiation. That's a market signal.</p>

                    <p>For anyone managing vendor relationships involving professional services—audit, assurance, consulting, advisory—this creates an anchor. When your vendor says AI doesn't change their pricing, you now have a documented counterexample from one of the most sophisticated buyers in the market. When procurement asks why you're not getting similar savings, you'll need an answer.</p>

                    <h2>Two Futures, Same Technology</h2>

                    <p>Here's where it gets complicated.</p>

                    <p><strong>Scenario one: Healthy repricing.</strong> The audit market has been overpriced for years. AI handles the rote work—transaction testing, document review, pattern matching—while humans focus on judgment-heavy areas. Efficiency gains create genuine competition. Fees come down. Quality stays the same or improves.</p>

                    <p>This is the optimistic case. Technology absorbs the mechanical work, and the humans who remain do the parts that require actual expertise. The economics work because you're paying for judgment where judgment matters, and letting automation handle the rest.</p>

                    <p><strong>Scenario two: Degraded quality via economic pressure.</strong> Lower fees mean lower margins. Lower margins mean firms cut the expensive part—human expertise. AI gets used not to augment judgment but to replace it, because the economics no longer support having experienced auditors do the work. The "human in the loop" becomes a rubber stamp on AI-generated workpapers.</p>

                    <p>We've seen this pattern before in other industries. When fee pressure compresses margins below the level required to maintain quality, firms have three choices: exit the market, accept lower margins, or cut corners. The firms that stay often choose the third option, and the consequences surface years later.</p>

                    <p>We don't know which future we're getting.</p>

                    <h2>Grant Thornton's Response Is the Tell</h2>

                    <p>Their statement: "High-quality audits rely heavily on expert human judgment, so our fees reflect both the cost of our people and the cost of the technology that supports them."</p>

                    <p>Translation: Quality requires humans. Humans cost money. When fees compress, something gives.</p>

                    <p>This is the tension that runs through every conversation about AI and professional services. The technology creates genuine efficiency gains—nobody disputes that. The question is whether those gains get reinvested in quality, returned to clients as savings, or extracted as margin while quality quietly degrades.</p>

                    <p>KPMG's own hedging is notable too: "While it is true AI can create efficiencies, developing and operating AI systems can generate additional costs."</p>

                    <p>Even they're not claiming this is pure savings. They're acknowledging that AI infrastructure requires investment. The 14% reduction isn't a measure of AI's efficiency gains—it's a negotiating position dressed up as one.</p>

                    <h2>The Question Nobody's Answering</h2>

                    <p>The question isn't whether AI can make auditing more efficient. It can.</p>

                    <p>The question is whether the fee pressure KPMG just legitimized will let firms invest in doing it right—or whether it creates a race to the bottom where AI coverage substitutes for professional judgment.</p>

                    <p>This matters for <a href="soc-2-type-2-reality.html">everyone who relies on audit reports</a>. When you receive a SOC 2 or a financial statement audit, you're trusting that someone with expertise actually examined the evidence and exercised judgment. If the economics push auditors toward AI-generated workpapers with minimal human review, that trust becomes hollow.</p>

                    <p>The problem is that <a href="the-self-attestation-problem.html">audit quality is invisible until it fails</a>. A degraded audit looks exactly like a quality audit until something goes wrong. The fee negotiations will be long forgotten by then. The procurement team that celebrated the 14% savings will have moved on. The consequences land on whoever was relying on that audit to catch problems it was no longer equipped to find.</p>

                    <p>Audit failures don't announce themselves in advance. They surface years later, after the damage is done.</p>

                    <blockquote>
                        "When procurement pressure meets professional judgment, which one wins?"
                    </blockquote>

                    <p>KPMG just gave us the opening data point. The answer to that question will take years to become clear—and by then, the market will have moved.</p>

                            <p><strong>Trevor Kavanaugh</strong> | VP, Third-Party Risk Management</p>
                            <p>With over a decade in banking, I've built my career across the risk spectrum—from compliance and BSA/AML to internal audit, now leading third-party risk management at an FDIC-chartered regional bank with DFPI oversight. This journey gave me a ground-level view of how risk actually functions across financial institutions.</p>
                            <p>I believe in building risk frameworks designed for modern, evolving threats—not just satisfying checkboxes. Risk management runs deeper than prescriptive compliance rules. It's abstract, constantly shifting, and demands continuous adaptation. I challenge legacy thinking and status quo approaches to push our profession forward.</p>
                            <p>My goal is simple: help everyone do better.</p>
