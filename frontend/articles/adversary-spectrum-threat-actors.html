                    <p>Not all cyberattacks are created equal. And the threats your vendors face depend entirely on who's targeting them. Your due diligence probably asks whether vendors have security controls. It probably doesn't ask <strong>who those controls are designed to stop</strong>.</p>

                    <p>That distinction matters more than most risk assessments acknowledge. A vendor can have a clean SOC 2 and still be woefully unprepared for the adversaries actually targeting their industry. Understanding the threat spectrum helps you ask better questions and make more informed risk decisions.</p>

                    <h2>Script Kiddies: The Baseline Test</h2>

                    <p>Low-skill attackers using tools someone else built. They're not targeting your vendor specifically—they're scanning the internet for anyone with an unlocked door. Automated, opportunistic, high volume, low sophistication.</p>

                    <p>Basic security hygiene stops them. Patched systems, disabled default credentials, firewall rules that aren't wide open. If your vendor can't handle this tier, you have bigger problems than threat modeling. This is the minimum bar, and it's the only tier where a checkbox approach to security actually works.</p>

                    <h2>Hacktivists: Politically Motivated Exposure</h2>

                    <p>These attackers are politically motivated. They're not after money—they want attention. Website defacement, data leaks meant to embarrass, DDoS attacks timed to news cycles.</p>

                    <p>Critically, they pick targets based on <strong>what the company represents</strong>, not what they can extract. A vendor serving oil companies, defense contractors, or government agencies faces more exposure here than one serving accounting firms. The industry your vendor operates in—and the clients they serve—determines their hacktivist risk profile. A fintech serving controversial industries inherits that controversy.</p>

                    <h2>Criminal Organizations: The Business of Breach</h2>

                    <p>This is ransomware. Data theft for sale. Business email compromise. Financially motivated, increasingly sophisticated, run like businesses. They do cost-benefit analysis. If your vendor holds valuable data and has weak defenses, they're a target.</p>

                    <p>Unlike script kiddies, they'll probe for weeks before striking. Unlike hacktivists, they don't care about politics. They care about getting paid. Criminal organizations are patient and methodical. They're looking for the path of least resistance to the highest-value target. A vendor with access to customer financial data, healthcare records, or payment systems is inherently more attractive than one managing office supplies.</p>

                    <p>The sophistication gap between script kiddies and organized crime is enormous. Controls that stop the former won't necessarily stop the latter.</p>

                    <h2>Nation-State Actors: A Different Threat Model Entirely</h2>

                    <p>Well-funded. Patient. Persistent. They're not looking for quick payouts—they're conducting espionage, positioning for future disruption, or targeting supply chains to reach someone else entirely.</p>

                    <p>If your vendor serves defense, critical infrastructure, government, healthcare, or financial services—nation-states are in the threat model whether the vendor acknowledges it or not. The question isn't whether nation-states would target your vendor directly. The question is whether your vendor is a stepping stone to their actual target.</p>

                    <p>SolarWinds wasn't breached by criminals looking for ransom. It was a nation-state operation targeting the vendor's customers <em>through</em> the vendor. The software supply chain became the attack vector precisely because it provided access to high-value targets that would have been harder to breach directly.</p>

                    <h2>Why This Matters for TPRM</h2>

                    <p>Same SOC 2. Same security questionnaire. Completely different threat exposure.</p>

                    <p>A vendor providing marketing analytics and a vendor embedded in critical infrastructure face fundamentally different adversaries. Your risk assessment should reflect that reality. The marketing analytics vendor probably needs to worry about criminal organizations and opportunistic attacks. The critical infrastructure vendor needs to assume nation-states are actively interested.</p>

                    <p>This doesn't mean you need to redesign your assessment framework for every vendor. It means you need to understand that <strong>threat exposure varies based on who the vendor is, what they do, and who they serve</strong>. A clean audit report tells you the vendor met a standard. It doesn't tell you whether that standard is sufficient for the adversaries actually targeting them.</p>

                    <blockquote>
                        "A vendor can have a clean SOC 2 and still be woefully unprepared for the adversaries actually targeting their industry."
                    </blockquote>

                    <p><strong>Do you know which of your vendors are likely targets for sophisticated attackers—or do you assess them all the same way?</strong></p>

                            <p><strong>Trevor Kavanaugh</strong> | VP, Third-Party Risk Management</p>
                            <p>With over a decade in banking, I've built my career across the risk spectrum—from compliance and BSA/AML to internal audit, now leading third-party risk management at an FDIC-chartered regional bank with DFPI oversight. This journey gave me a ground-level view of how risk actually functions across financial institutions.</p>
                            <p>I believe in building risk frameworks designed for modern, evolving threats—not just satisfying checkboxes. Risk management runs deeper than prescriptive compliance rules. It's abstract, constantly shifting, and demands continuous adaptation. I challenge legacy thinking and status quo approaches to push our profession forward.</p>
                            <p>My goal is simple: help everyone do better.</p>
