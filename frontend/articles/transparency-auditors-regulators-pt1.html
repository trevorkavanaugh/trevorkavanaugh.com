                    <p>When auditors and regulators discover a control gap you didn't disclose, there are only two interpretations: You're not competent enough to identify your own problems, or you were hiding them.</p>

                    <p>Both are worse than transparency.</p>

                    <p>I spent two years in internal audit before returning to risk management. The biggest thing that surprised me during that time? Every business unit I walked into to audit seemed scared of me.</p>

                    <p>But I was really just there to help.</p>

                    <p>That fear? It shows up in every audit and exam I've seen since. And it costs banks credibility they don't realize they're losing.</p>

                    <h2>Here's What Actually Happens When You Don't Disclose Known Control Gaps</h2>

                    <p>Your auditors and examiners have 40-60 hours to assess your entire program. Every hour they spend rediscovering issues you already identified is an hour they're not spending finding the gaps you missed.</p>

                    <p>Staying quiet doesn't protect you. It just wastes their time and signals one of two things: Either your internal monitoring isn't mature enough to catch problems, or you knew and chose not to say anything.</p>

                    <p>Neither builds trust.</p>

                    <h2>From the Auditor and Examiner Side of the Table</h2>

                    <p>I can tell you what credibility looks like: It's not a perfect program. It's self-awareness.</p>

                    <p>Walk in with documented gaps, what caused them, and your remediation timeline — that's what credibility looks like. You're showing them a risk function that can identify and address issues on its own. As I discuss in <a href="transparency-auditors-regulators-pt2.html">the follow-up to this article</a>, auditors actually measure program maturity through self-identification ratios.</p>

                    <p>When they have to discover everything themselves? That's the opposite signal.</p>

                    <blockquote>
                        "Banks that treat examiners and auditors as adversaries waste everyone's time. The ones that treat them as quality assurance reviews get better findings."
                    </blockquote>

                    <h2>Using Audit and Examination Time Well</h2>

                    <p>Your auditors and examiners aren't there to catch you. They're there because they have more time than you do to find problems in your program — and that's valuable if you let it be.</p>

                    <p>This isn't about making examiners happy. It's about using their time well and showing you can identify problems on your own. The banks that treat <a href="regulatory-compliance-minimum-not-goal.html">regulatory compliance as the baseline, not the goal</a>, understand this instinctively.</p>

                    <p>The control gaps are getting found either way. You're just choosing how you want to look when they do.</p>

                            <p><strong>Trevor Kavanaugh</strong> | VP, Third-Party Risk Management</p>
                            <p>With over a decade in banking, I've built my career across the risk spectrum—from compliance and BSA/AML to internal audit, now leading third-party risk management at an FDIC-chartered regional bank with DFPI oversight. This journey gave me a ground-level view of how risk actually functions across financial institutions.</p>
                            <p>I believe in building risk frameworks designed for modern, evolving threats—not just satisfying checkboxes. Risk management runs deeper than prescriptive compliance rules. It's abstract, constantly shifting, and demands continuous adaptation. I challenge legacy thinking and status quo approaches to push our profession forward.</p>
                            <p>My goal is simple: help everyone do better.</p>
