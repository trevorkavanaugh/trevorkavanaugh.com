                    <p>Your vendor's <a href="soc-2-type-2-reality.html">SOC 2 report</a> covers their product. It says so right on the cover. Except it might not. And most people reviewing it would never know. SOC 2 audits have a design feature that doubles as a loophole: the vendor defines the scope. They decide which trust services criteria get tested, which systems are included, which infrastructure is carved out, and where the boundaries of "the system" begin and end.</p>

                    <p>That's not a flaw in the standard. It's how SOC 2 was designed&mdash;flexible enough to apply across industries, sizes, and architectures. But that same flexibility means two vendors offering identical services can produce SOC 2 reports with wildly different coverage. And unless you know what to look for, both reports look equally reassuring.</p>

                    <h2>This Happens at Multiple Levels</h2>

                    <p>Some scoping decisions are obvious if you know where to look. A vendor only selects Security as their trust services criteria and skips Availability, Confidentiality, and Privacy&mdash;even though they're storing your NPPI and you need them operational around the clock. That's visible on page one if you check. But most reviewers don't check. They see "SOC 2 Type II" on the cover page and move on, assuming the report validates what they need it to validate.</p>

                    <p>Some decisions are subtler. The vendor carves out their cloud infrastructure provider entirely. The report covers the vendor's application-level controls&mdash;authentication, access management, change control&mdash;but explicitly excludes the environment those controls run on. There's a line buried in the system description or the complementary user entity controls section that says so. It might read something like "The Company relies on Amazon Web Services for infrastructure services, which are excluded from the scope of this examination." That one sentence changes the meaning of the entire report. Most reviewers never find it.</p>

                    <p>And some scoping choices are almost invisible. The vendor defines "the system" in a way that sounds comprehensive but quietly excludes backend components, internal tools, or integration layers that touch your data. The system description reads well. It describes the product architecture, the data flows, and the control environment in professional language. It just doesn't describe everything that matters. The staging environment where engineers test with production data? Out of scope. The internal admin tool with direct database access? Not mentioned. The third-party integration layer that passes your data to another service? Carved out in a footnote.</p>

                    <h2>Why This Matters for Due Diligence</h2>

                    <p>Every one of these scoping decisions is technically legitimate. The auditor tests exactly what the scope says. The opinion is clean. The report looks professional. Nothing in the SOC 2 framework prevents a vendor from drawing scope lines that exclude significant parts of their operating environment. The standard is working as designed.</p>

                    <p>But if your risk assessment assumes the SOC 2 covers the full environment&mdash;and the scope was drawn to exclude significant pieces&mdash;your assurance has gaps you don't know about. You're making risk decisions based on what you think the report covers, not what it actually covers. And the distance between those two things can be substantial.</p>

                    <p>This is particularly dangerous when combined with <a href="soc-2-timing-gap.html">the timing gap inherent in SOC 2 reporting</a>. You're already working with historical evidence. If that historical evidence also covers a narrower scope than you assumed, your actual assurance is a fraction of what your risk documentation suggests. Your file says "SOC 2 Type II received and reviewed." Your actual coverage might be limited to application-layer security controls tested over a period that ended months ago, with infrastructure, availability, and data privacy entirely unexamined.</p>

                    <p>The fix isn't complicated, but it requires changing how you read these reports. Don't start with the opinion letter. Start with the system description. Read it like a boundary document, not a marketing summary. Ask: what's included? What's explicitly excluded? What's conspicuously absent? If the vendor stores your data in a cloud environment but the cloud provider is carved out, that's a gap. If they handle NPPI but didn't include the Privacy criteria, that's a gap. If their system description doesn't mention components you know exist in their architecture, that's worth a conversation.</p>

                    <p>The point isn't that vendors are being deceptive. Most scoping decisions reflect legitimate business and audit considerations. The point is that <a href="the-self-attestation-problem.html">the vendor controls the narrative</a>, and you need to understand what story they chose to tell&mdash;and what they left out.</p>

                        "Two vendors offering identical services can produce SOC 2 reports with wildly different coverage. Unless you know what to look for, both reports look equally reassuring."
                    </blockquote>

                    <p>Over the next few posts, we're going to walk through each of these scoping layers in detail. What to look for, where to find it in the report, and how vendors use legitimate scoping flexibility to narrow what actually gets tested. If you've been treating SOC 2 receipt as SOC 2 assurance, this series will change how you read every report that crosses your desk.</p>

                            <p><strong>Trevor Kavanaugh</strong> | VP, Third-Party Risk Management</p>
                            <p>With over a decade in banking, I've built my career across the risk spectrum—from compliance and BSA/AML to internal audit, now leading third-party risk management at an FDIC-chartered regional bank with DFPI oversight. This journey gave me a ground-level view of how risk actually functions across financial institutions.</p>
                            <p>I believe in building risk frameworks designed for modern, evolving threats—not just satisfying checkboxes. Risk management runs deeper than prescriptive compliance rules. It's abstract, constantly shifting, and demands continuous adaptation. I challenge legacy thinking and status quo approaches to push our profession forward.</p>
                            <p>My goal is simple: help everyone do better.</p>
