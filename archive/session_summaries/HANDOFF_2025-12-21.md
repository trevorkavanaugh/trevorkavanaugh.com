- **Created STATUS.md** - Living project status document with phases, priorities, technical notes
- **Reorganized directory structure:**
  ```

### 2. Articles Section Implementation (Phase 4.5)

- **Updated homepage** with 3 featured article previews
- **Consistent navigation** across all 17+ pages

### 3. Site Rebrand (Phase 5)

**Removed sections:**
- Stats bar (years, clients, risk mitigated)
- "Why Independent Third-Party Risk Consulting?"
- Services section (4 cards)
- Process section ("How I Work")
- Case Study section

**New branding:**
- **Name:** "TPRM Insights" (was "Risk Management Consulting")

- **Focus:** Thought leadership, not selling services
- **LinkedIn:** https://www.linkedin.com/in/trevorskavanaugh/

**Current homepage flow:**
