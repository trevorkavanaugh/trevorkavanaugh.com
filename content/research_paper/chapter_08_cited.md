# Chapter 8: Where Framework Scope Ends and New Risks Begin

The seven incidents reveal a systematic pattern: every major TPRM framework was designed for different risk categories than those that have since emerged as most material. Organizations followed the playbooks—this is not execution failure. It's a fundamental disconnect between what frameworks were designed to assess and where actual threats now manifest.

| Incident | Attack Vector | DORA's Scope Limitations | SOC 2's Design Boundaries | SBOM/CISA Scope Gaps |
|----------|---------------|------------------|-------------------|-----------------------|
| **SolarWinds (2020)** | Build environment compromise enabling code injection during compilation | DORA's ICT risk management does not specifically address build pipeline integrity or artifact verification[1] | SOC 2 assesses change management policies but not build environment isolation, reproducible builds, or signing key protection[2] | SBOMs show what components are declared but cannot verify binaries match source code or detect build-time injection |
| **Log4j (2021)** | Transitive dependency 5-10 levels deep in open source library | No mandate for transitive dependency inventory or vulnerability correlation | No requirement to maintain component inventories or assess open source supply chain | SBOM mandate came *after* Log4j; financial services lacks enforcement mechanism for SBOM requirements |
| **Kaseya VSA (2021)** | RMM platform compromise propagating through MSP customer base | DORA addresses concentration risk at organizational level but not technology platform concentration (multiple vendors using same RMM)[5] | SOC 2 of MSP assesses their security practices but not the specific RMM platform security posture they've chosen | SBOM of MSP's service would not capture the RMM tool's internal components or vulnerabilities |
| **3CX (2023)** | Cascading supply chain: compromised legacy software → employee device → build environment → customer distribution | DORA requires exit strategies for dependencies but was not designed to address vendor employee's personal software choices | SOC 2 was not scoped to cover employee personal device security or vendor's upstream dependencies unrelated to service delivery | SBOM from 3CX would show DesktopApp components after compromise but could not prevent the attack originating from employee's personal device |
| **MOVEit (2023)** | Zero-day in widely-used MFT platform affecting customers through vendor dependencies | DORA requires mapping ICT dependencies but provides no mechanism to discover 4th-party tool choices like MFT platforms[4] | SOC 2 Type II of TIAA would not reveal that PBI (their subcontractor) uses MOVEit Transfer for file handling—not because SOC 2 failed, but because operational tools were not part of its original scope | SBOM from TIAA would not include PBI's operational infrastructure choices; MOVEit is infrastructure not a software component |
| **xz Utils (2024)** | Backdoor inserted by compromised open source maintainer targeting SSH authentication | DORA provides no framework for monitoring open source maintainer activity or project health | SOC 2 was not designed to assess the security of individual open source dependencies or their maintenance practices | SBOM would list xz Utils as a component but could not detect malicious code inserted by trusted maintainer with commit access |
| **CrowdStrike (2024)** | Automatic security tool update bypassing testing and customer controls | DORA requires resilience testing but no framework mandates staged deployment for security tool updates[3] | SOC 2 was not built to assess update deployment practices for products vendors sell (only vendor's own IT systems) | SBOM irrelevant—the faulty component was a configuration file, not a software library; problem was deployment process not component vulnerability |

The pattern is stark: **none of these attacks occurred through vectors that existing frameworks were designed to detect.**

**Build Integrity Blind Spot**: SolarWinds and 3CX both exploited build environment access. SOC 2's CC8.1 (Change Management) assesses whether organizations have code review and testing processes but was not designed to verify build environment isolation, signing key protection, or reproducible build capabilities[6]. SLSA Level 3+ would require hardened, isolated builds with non-falsifiable provenance—but no regulatory framework mandates SLSA compliance, and no Big 4 firm offers SLSA attestation services[7]. (See Chapter 9 for comprehensive analysis of how SOC 2 could evolve to address these emerging risks.)

**Transitive Dependency Invisibility**: Log4j demonstrated that 60% of vulnerabilities exist in dependencies pulled transitively—components organizations do not directly choose and often do not know they use. SOC 2's CC9.2 addresses vendor relationships (organizational entities) but not software component dependencies (technical artifacts)[8]. DORA requires mapping ICT dependencies but provides no technical specification for depth or granularity[9]. SBOMs can theoretically capture transitive dependencies, but only 51% of organizations validate received SBOMs, and tools frequently miss components with incomplete metadata[10].

**Automatic Update Authority**: CrowdStrike revealed that security tools require automatic update authority to function effectively—but this creates concentration risk when updates bypass testing.[13] No framework addresses pre-deployment testing mandates for security tool updates, staged rollout requirements, or customer control over deployment timing for non-emergency updates. The tension between security responsiveness and operational stability exists outside current compliance structures.

**Fourth-Party Tool Opacity**: MOVEit and Kaseya demonstrate that the tools vendors use to deliver services (MFT platforms, RMM software) are invisible to traditional vendor management. SOC 2 may carve out subservice organizations like AWS, but operational tools like MOVEit Transfer are not considered "subservice organizations"—they're infrastructure choices[11]. Contracts typically do not require vendors to disclose what file transfer mechanisms or remote management platforms they employ.

**Concentration Risk at the Technology Layer**: Multiple incidents (CrowdStrike affecting 50% of Fortune 500, Kaseya affecting 75% of MSP market, MOVEit cascading through retirement administrators) demonstrate concentration risk exists at the technology platform level, not just the vendor level. Organizations using different vendors for different services were still simultaneously affected because those vendors converged on common underlying platforms. No framework systematically assesses or addresses this convergent concentration risk.

**The Framework-Reality Disconnect**: The parties-versus-dependencies mismatch described in Chapter 4 manifests consistently across all seven incidents. When your data is exposed through your retirement administrator's audit service provider's managed file transfer platform, mapping legal entity relationships provides no useful risk insight.

As one analysis concluded: "Third-party risk now includes your fourth and fifth parties, too. Many victims of the breach did not even know MOVEit was in use, because it was used by a vendor's vendor."[12] Until frameworks address this architectural mismatch, the structural gap will persist.

Understanding what frameworks missed is necessary but insufficient. The next chapter quantifies the cost of these gaps.

DORA's ICT Risk Management Framework (Article 6) addresses governance, risk identification, protection measures, detection, response, and recovery, but does not specifically mandate build pipeline integrity controls, artifact verification, or reproducible builds.

[2] American Institute of CPAs (AICPA), "Trust Services Criteria," 2017 (with 2022 revised points of focus). SOC 2 Common Criterion CC8.1 (Change Management) requires organizations to "authorize, design, develop or acquire, configure, document, test, approve, and implement changes to infrastructure, data, software, and procedures," but does not require verification of build environment isolation, hermetic builds, or signing key protection practices.

[3] European Union, DORA Article 25 (Digital operational resilience testing). DORA requires financial entities to conduct vulnerability assessments, network security testing, and threat-led penetration testing (TLPT) for systemically important institutions, but does not mandate staged deployment, canary releases, or pre-deployment testing requirements for security tool configuration updates.

[4] European Union, DORA Article 28 (Register of information in relation to contractual arrangements on the use of ICT services). DORA requires financial entities to maintain registers identifying ICT third-party service providers and mapping ICT dependencies, but the Register of Information focuses on legal entities providing ICT services rather than the specific tools (e.g., MFT platforms, RMM software) that vendors use operationally.

[5] European Union, DORA Article 28(3)(g) requires assessment of "concentration of ICT third-party service providers at entity or group level." However, this addresses concentration at the organizational vendor level, not at the technology platform level where multiple independent vendors converge on the same underlying tools (e.g., multiple MSPs all using Kaseya VSA).

[6] AICPA Trust Services Criteria, CC8.1 (Change Management). The criterion addresses whether organizations have processes for code review, testing, and deployment approval, but does not require specific technical controls such as: build environment isolation from development networks, ephemeral build systems, non-falsifiable provenance generation, or reproducible build verification.

[7] Google, "Supply-chain Levels for Software Artifacts (SLSA) Framework," v1.1 specification, April 2025, https://slsa.dev/. SLSA Level 3 requires hardened builds with isolated/ephemeral build environments and non-falsifiable provenance. As of December 2025, no Big 4 audit firm (Deloitte, PwC, EY, KPMG) offers formal SLSA attestation services; compliance remains self-assessed with specialized security vendors offering consulting.

[8] AICPA Trust Services Criteria, CC9.2 (Vendor and Business Partner Risk Management). The 2022 revision added language about "identifying and evaluating vulnerabilities arising from vendor and business partner relationships," but this addresses organizational relationships (collecting vendor SOC reports, reviewing contracts) rather than software component dependencies like open-source libraries or transitive dependencies.

[9] European Union, DORA Article 28 (ICT Third-Party Risk Management). While DORA requires mapping ICT dependencies and maintaining a Register of Information on ICT service providers, the regulation provides no technical specification for dependency inventory depth (direct vs. transitive), granularity (library-level vs. service-level), or format (e.g., SBOM standards).

[10] Linux Foundation/OpenSSF, "Toward a Comprehensive Software Supply Chain Assurance Framework for Financial Institutions," 2024 industry analysis. Research indicates only 51% of organizations validate received SBOMs, and SBOM generation tools frequently miss components with incomplete metadata, components installed dynamically at runtime, or components embedded as binaries rather than declared as dependencies.

SOC 2 allows service organizations to "carve out" subservice organizations (e.g., AWS for infrastructure) using Complementary Subservice Organization Controls (CSOCs). However, operational tools like MOVEit Transfer (MFT platforms) or Kaseya VSA (RMM platforms) are typically not considered "subservice organizations" requiring carve-out disclosure—they are treated as internal technical implementation choices.

Emsisoft's analysis found that "for almost two-thirds of MOVEit victims, breaches occurred because their third-party vendors used MOVEit—or their vendor's vendors used the file-transfer service."

Endpoint security tools require kernel-level access and rapid update capabilities to detect and respond to emerging threats. The rapid response content mechanism enabled CrowdStrike to deploy threat detection updates within hours of identifying new attack patterns, but this same mechanism propagated the faulty configuration update that caused the July 2024 outage.
