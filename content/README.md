# LinkedIn Thought Leadership Strategy

## Purpose
This directory manages Trevor's LinkedIn thought leadership content focused on Third-Party Risk Management (TPRM) expertise and banking risk management visibility.

## Success Story
After just 1.5 months of consistent posting (November 2025 - mid-December 2025), this thought leadership strategy resulted in an invitation to speak at a GARP (Global Association of Risk Professionals) event. This demonstrates the power of authentic, expertise-driven content in establishing professional credibility.
