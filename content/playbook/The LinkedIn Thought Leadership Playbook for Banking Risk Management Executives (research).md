# The LinkedIn Thought Leadership Playbook for Banking Risk Management Executives

**Trevor Kavanaugh's 6-Month Strategy to Establish Domain Expert Status**

Trevor has a rare advantage: deep TPRM expertise combined with technical automation skills, M&A experience, and cross-functional banking knowledge. His recent posts already resonate with senior risk and compliance professionals at major institutions. This playbook transforms that early traction into recognized thought leadership, systematically building impressions and establishing Trevor as THE expert voice in banking risk management.

## The opportunity landscape

**Senior banking executives are drowning in complexity.** Third-party risk management ranks as the #2-3 concern after cybersecurity, with 90% viewing TPRM as a growing priority. AI adoption creates governance challenges (only 38% of AI projects meet ROI). M&A integration failures reach 83%. Regulatory uncertainty dominates 2025 planning. Meanwhile, **71% of executives feel most thought leadership doesn't provide valuable insights**, and **81% prefer provocative ideas that challenge assumptions** over content validating current thinking.

This creates Trevor's opening. Banking executives on LinkedIn are time-constrained but information-hungry. They engage when content directly addresses current challenges with data-driven, actionable frameworks from peer perspectives. They scroll past generic advice, vendor pitches, and theoretical frameworks lacking application. Trevor's practitioner experience solving these exact problems positions him to cut through the noise.

## Understanding the LinkedIn algorithm in 2024-2025

LinkedIn's algorithm prioritizes keeping users on-platform through dwell time and engagement velocity. **The first 90 minutes after posting determines total reach.** Early engagement signals quality to the algorithm, which then amplifies the post to broader audiences. Multi-image posts receive 1.6x average reach (highest performing format), while posts with external links suffer 6x less reach than those without.

The platform favors variety—posting the same format three times consecutively reduces reach by 30-35%. **Engagement rate matters more than follower count.** Small accounts generate 16 impressions per 100 followers per post, while large accounts see just 3 impressions per 100 followers. The algorithm rewards substantive comments over simple "great post" reactions, prioritizes content from profiles with optimized keywords in skills and specialisms, and gives higher search priority to Featured section content.

For B2B thought leadership specifically, optimal posting occurs Tuesday through Thursday between 8-11 AM. Personal profiles should post maximum once daily—multiple posts in 24 hours split reach. Carousel posts lose 10% reach per additional 500 characters beyond the initial caption. Video posts perform best at 80 seconds with vertical format, subtitles (40% view increase), and custom thumbnails.

## Your target audience decoded

Senior management in US financial institutions—specifically those making decisions about risk, compliance, operations, M&A, and vendor management—exhibit distinct LinkedIn behaviors. They're selective engagers who consume more than they create, but when they engage, it's purposeful and strategic. **65% of engagement happens on mobile** during business hours, with Tuesday-Thursday showing strongest activity.

These executives stop scrolling for personal stories with professional relevance, data-driven insights with specific benchmarks, regulatory updates with practical implications, and contrarian but well-reasoned perspectives. They comment (rather than just like) when questions seek their input, controversial takes challenge current thinking, or content relates directly to immediate challenges. Comments signal opportunities to demonstrate expertise.

**What keeps them awake in 2025:** Non-financial risks now overtake traditional financial risks. Cybersecurity and fraud rank #1, with $10.5 trillion in annual cybercrime costs projected. TPRM challenges intensify—managing 50-250+ vendors per institution, with ~20% capable of causing material harm. The CrowdStrike outage highlighted concentration risk. Recent fines include American Express ($15M) and Metropolitan Commercial Bank ($30M). AI adoption creates governance puzzles—80%+ plan increased tech investment, but only 38% of AI projects meet ROI, and 60%+ experience significant delays. Regulatory uncertainty dominates as the new administration creates unpredictable environments. M&A integration challenges persist, with 25% expecting to merge and 83% citing integration failures.

They follow and engage with Jim Marous (digital banking transformation), Ron Shevlin (fintech skepticism via Forbes' "Fintech Snark Tank"), Chris Skinner (global banking futurist with 17 published books), and industry publications like American Banker and Bank Director. Topics gaining traction include AI implementation with real use cases, TPRM frameworks and technology solutions, post-M&A integration war stories, operational resilience, cost efficiency, regulatory technology adoption, and non-financial risk management frameworks.

**Content that falls flat:** Generic "AI is the future" without specifics, vendor pitches, regulatory updates without interpretation, corporate jargon, unsubstantiated claims, overly academic theory, and fear-mongering without solutions.

## Content characteristics that maximize performance

### Post length and structure

**Optimal length for engagement: 1,300-2,000 characters** (approximately 250-400 words). B2B decision-makers in finance prefer longer posts than creative professionals. Posts under 1,900-2,000 characters generate the greatest views, likes, comments, and shares. However, carousel posts should stay under 500 characters in the caption to avoid the 10% reach penalty per additional 500 characters.

**The critical "see more" threshold sits at 200-210 characters on desktop.** Your hook must grab attention in this space. Posts with strong hooks generate 45% more engagement than generic openers. Stories starting with hooks are 22 times more memorable than plain facts.

### Hook formulas that work

Start with questions ("What if everything we know about vendor risk is wrong?"), bold statements (unexpected claims backed by data), intriguing observations (surprising statistics), or pattern breaks (unexpected format changes). Effective examples include "I'll never forget the day our M&A integration nearly failed..." or "Did you know 60% of TPRM programs fail within 18 months?" Personal anecdotes creating curiosity consistently outperform generic openings.

### Formatting for mobile dominance

**Posts with proper white space receive 57% more engagement** than dense text blocks. Use 1-2 line breaks between related sentences and 2-3 line breaks between different topics. Keep paragraphs to 1-3 lines maximum. Strategic line breaks increase engagement by 45% versus dense formatting. Properly formatted posts receive 3x more dwell time.

Bold key points for emphasis. Use bullet points and numbered lists for structure, but limit to 2 lists per post maximum (3-5 items each). Deploy up to 10 emojis maximum, only when complementing (not cluttering) the message. Use symbols (→, ✓, •) for visual interest and single-sentence paragraphs for impact.

### Storytelling frameworks that resonate

Personal stories generate 300% more engagement than generic advice. The most effective structure follows: **Challenge → Action → Result → Lesson Learned**. This framework provides both entertainment and education.

Layer in vivid setup details (regular text), introduce tension or conflict (italics for emotional connection), deliver payoff with bold impact, and state the moral element in a separate sentence (clarity over creativity). Focus on relatable scenarios with specific, concrete details. Make content about the audience, not self-promotion.

### When controversy drives reach

**81% of B2B decision-makers favor provocative ideas challenging assumptions,** yet only 18% of thought leadership content rates as "excellent or very good." Controversy works when tied to your expertise, serves your audience with insights (not venting), supports career goals, and frames arguments thoughtfully with evidence.

Safe controversy strategies include challenging status quo with data, sharing contrarian takes backed by reasoning, myth-busting common misconceptions, and taking calculated stances on relevant professional topics. For higher-risk industries like finance, careful approach with substantive backing proves essential. Question industry norms, address "everyone says X, but actually Y," and provide alternative approaches to common problems.

Manage risk by pausing before reacting to backlash, clarifying points if misunderstood, acknowledging valid concerns professionally, and owning your perspective while staying open to discussion. Avoid needlessly combative language. Personality polarizes but distinguishes—not everyone needs to like you, but content needs conviction.

### Visual elements and format performance

**Format performance rankings for 2024-2025:**

**Carousel posts (PDF/documents): 1.6x average reach** (highest performing). Educational "how-to" carousels work best. Keep 5-10 slides optimal—engagement drops after the 6th-7th slide. Use 1080 x 1080 pixels (1:1 square ratio), 25-50 words per slide, strong hook on first slide, and visual consistency (3 colors maximum). Post Tuesday/Thursday between 8-11 AM. Educational content outperforms promotional by massive margins (-60 to -70% for product presentations).

**Image posts: 1.26x average reach.** Human faces generate 30% more reach plus 50% more engagement. Visually relevant images add 15-20% reach. Meaningful selfies boost up to 30% reach. Each additional image (up to 5) adds 5% reach. Avoid generic stock photos (-15%), screenshots (-15%), and product promotions (-75%). Multi-image posts generate 6.60% engagement rate—the highest of any format.

**Video posts:** Ideal duration is 80 seconds with 40% better engagement and 70% retention rate. Beyond 3 minutes sees -15% performance. The first 8 seconds are critical (30% of viewers leave if not hooked). Vertical videos outperform square by 15% and horizontal by 25%. Quality images and sound boost engagement by 50%. Subtitles increase views by 40% (35% watch without sound). Add custom thumbnails and clear CTAs at the end.

**Text-only posts** still work for narratives and external CTAs (25% higher click-through rate). Post Monday-Friday, 10 AM-noon. Can post multiple text posts consecutively without penalty (but max 1/day recommended).

**Critical rule: Mix formats.** Posting the same format 3x in a row reduces reach by 30-35%.

### External links destroy reach

Posts with links get **6x less reach** than posts without. External URLs see 25-40% reduction in visibility. Posts without links get 4x more reactions and 18x more comments. LinkedIn prioritizes keeping users on-platform, so external links trigger algorithmic deprioritization.

**Workaround strategies:** Add links in first comment (mention "Link in comments" in post). Wait 60+ minutes after posting for algorithm to score the post, then edit to add link. Convert content to LinkedIn-native formats (LinkedIn Articles don't hurt reach, blog posts converted to PDF carousels, LinkedIn Events instead of external event pages). Only include external links when absolutely necessary for critical resources.

### Hashtag strategy for 2025

Major changes in late 2024: users can no longer follow hashtags, they're removed from profile displays, no longer appear in dropdown search, and follower counts are hidden. Hashtags now work as **contextual ranking signals and SEO integration** rather than discovery tools.

Use **3-5 hashtags per post** (quality over quantity). Mix broad (#Leadership), niche (#TPRMinsights, #BankingRisk), and trending industry topics. Place hashtags at the end of posts to keep text clean. The critical shift: **combine hashtags with keyword strategy**. Optimize entire profile and posts with relevant keywords, not just hashtags. Use LinkedIn Business Pages' "Specialisms" (up to 20 keywords) and Personal Profiles' "Skills" section for keyword optimization.

### Calls-to-action that drive engagement

Questions at the end of posts increase engagement by 20-40%. Posts with questions generate more comments—the highest-value engagement type for algorithmic visibility. Effective CTAs include "What are your thoughts?", "Do you agree?", "What's been your experience with this?", "Which strategy has worked best for you?", and "What would you add to this list?"

Be specific—tell the audience exactly what to do. Keep it short with direct, clear language. Use action verbs (Share, Comment, Download, Join). Highlight benefits ("Comment below to get the template"). Match CTA to content. Focus on one primary CTA to avoid overwhelming readers. Avoid generic engagement requests without value delivery.

## Case studies: Proven paths to thought leadership

### Dan Sanchez: B2B marketing expert (16-month trajectory)

Dan grew from 500 connections to 10,000+ followers in 16 months, generating 3 million views and 20 million impressions. His strategy: **posted once daily for 90 consecutive days** to build the content creation muscle. Batch-created content weekly (2.5 hours every Monday). Spent **1.5 hours EVERY morning** engaging with influencers' content—specifically being first to comment with valuable insights on influencer posts.

Created an engagement group with 10-15 other consistent posters who supported each other's content. Engaged with 5+ posts immediately after publishing own content. Responded to all thoughtful comments. His content formula: Hook (first 2-3 lines grab attention) + Valuable actionable content + Easy-to-answer question at the end.

The 90-day sprint established posting rhythm and early followers. By 6 months, growth momentum accelerated. At 16 months, significant influence emerged with consistent business impact. **Key insight:** Volume over quality initially—practice improved skills. Engagement investment (1.5 hours daily) proved as important as content creation.

### Jim Marous: Digital banking transformation (10+ year authority)

Named Top 5 influencer in banking for 10 consecutive years, Jim co-publishes The Financial Brand and owns Digital Banking Report. He posts 3-5 times per week, mixing text insights, video discussions, infographics, long-form LinkedIn articles, and curated content from his research.

His breakthrough strategy: **proprietary research vehicles.** Annual "Digital Banking Trends & Predictions" reports (93 pages) crowdsource expertise from 100+ industry influencers. This positions him as curator and analyst of industry trends rather than just another commentator. Cross-platform amplification repurposes Digital Banking Report content across LinkedIn, podcast, and speaking engagements.

Building influence over 10+ years required consistency, independence from vendor interests, and network effects from collaborating with other influencers. Multi-platform presence (blog, podcast, LinkedIn, speaking) created compounding returns.

### Ron Shevlin: Fintech research and contrarian positioning

Chief Research Officer at Cornerstone Advisors and Senior Contributor at Forbes writing "Fintech Snark Tank," Ron built influence through **contrarian takes backed by proprietary data**. He posts multiple times per week with provocative text, shares Forbes articles, and delivers data-driven insights from Cornerstone research with humor and memorable "snark."

His content breaks through by challenging conventional wisdom (e.g., questioning banks' digital transformation claims), using anonymized research data from Cornerstone's work with 100+ financial institutions, and developing a distinctive brand voice. Forbes column amplification exponentially expanded his LinkedIn reach. **Twenty years of credibility building** in analyst roles (Forrester, Aite Group, Cornerstone) provided the foundation for thought leadership.

### Luvleen Sidhu: Banking-as-a-Service CEO (7-10 year build)

Chair, CEO & Founder of BM Technologies (NYSE: BMTX), Luvleen became one of the youngest female founders to take a company public at age 34. She built influence parallel to company growth (2015-present), leveraging company milestones for personal brand visibility.

Her content strategy focuses on **authentic entrepreneurial journey sharing**—milestone announcements (going public, awards, partnerships), behind-the-scenes vulnerability about challenges and pivots, industry insights from first-hand BaaS perspective, and mentorship content supporting other women entrepreneurs. Going public in 2021 created major visibility boost. Speaking at Money20/20 and Fintech Nexus plus media appearances (CNBC, Bloomberg, WSJ, Forbes) amplified LinkedIn presence.

**Critical pattern:** Willingness to share authentic challenges and business pivots (customer acquisition cost struggles leading to B2B2C model shift) built credibility far beyond polished corporate messaging.

### Chris Skinner: Global banking futurist (15-20 year authority)

With 17 published books including bestseller "Digital Bank," Chris maintains a **daily blog at TheFinanser.com updated every single day since 2007+**. This unprecedented consistency built massive SEO and authority. Each book launch created new content cycles and speaking opportunities. Global speaker in 50+ countries provides diverse perspectives. CEO interviews with JPMorgan Chase, BBVA, ING, DBS, and CMB offer behind-the-scenes access.

His future-focus (30-50 year predictions versus near-term tactics) distinguishes him from tactical advisors. Multiple revenue streams (consulting, speaking, books, advisory roles) monetize thought leadership. **Key insight:** Daily discipline for 15+ years compounds into industry-defining authority. Long-term thinking positions him above daily noise.

### Extractable patterns across all cases

**Timeline patterns:** Quick growth (18 months with intensive daily posting plus engagement), medium build (5-7 years parallel to career growth), long-term authority (10-20 years sustained consistency). **Posting frequency consensus:** Minimum 3-5 times weekly for visibility; daily posting for 90 days builds rapid momentum; 1-2 hours daily engaging with others' content; 2-3 hours weekly batch-creating content.

**Content formats that consistently work:** Long-form text posts with strong hooks, data-driven insights with specific numbers, personal stories with professional lessons, contrarian viewpoints challenging conventional wisdom, listicles with actionable takeaways, behind-the-scenes vulnerability and authentic challenges.

**Breakthrough accelerators:** Media appearances (CNBC, Bloomberg, WSJ), awards and recognition, speaking circuit visibility, book launches, proprietary research (annual reports establishing authority), partnerships and co-creating content with other influencers.

**Engagement strategies that matter:** Comment early on influencer posts (first 5-10 comments get visibility), add substantive value in comments (not "great post"), create engagement groups (10-15 creators supporting each other), respond to all thoughtful comments on your posts, engage 5+ times immediately after posting your content, invest 1-2 hours daily engaging before and after posting.

## Trevor's unique positioning and competitive advantage

Trevor combines rare expertise domains: deep TPRM knowledge (managing vendor ecosystems worth billions), technical automation skills (building efficiency into compliance programs), M&A integration experience (navigating risk culture challenges), and cross-functional banking knowledge spanning operations, technology, compliance, and strategy.

His positioning as **VP-level practitioner** (not consultant or vendor) provides authentic peer-to-peer credibility. Recent post performance with senior risk and compliance professionals at major institutions validates market demand for his perspective. His topic expertise aligns perfectly with top executive pain points: TPRM challenges (#2-3 concern), M&A integration (83% failure rate on integration), building compliance with minimal resources (universal challenge at regional banks), regulatory navigation (2025 uncertainty), and AI governance implementation.

**Trevor's contrarian angles:** Most TPRM content comes from vendors pitching solutions or consultants selling services. Trevor can share what actually works and doesn't work from the trenches. Most M&A integration content focuses on deal strategy; Trevor addresses the unsexy operational realities that determine success or failure. Most compliance content assumes unlimited resources; Trevor specializes in doing more with less at regional banks. Most regulatory content rehashes guidance; Trevor can interpret practical implications for mid-sized institutions.

**His content differentiation:** War stories with specific metrics ("How we reduced third-party reviews from 45 days to 12 days"), frameworks built from actual implementation ("The 5-stage TPRM maturity model regional banks can actually achieve"), contrarian takes backed by experience ("Why most vendor risk scoring is theater, and what works instead"), M&A integration reality checks ("The risk culture integration challenges everyone ignores until it's too late"), and regulatory interpretation for resource-constrained banks ("What the new OCC guidance actually means for a $5B bank").

**Posting frequency:** Maintain 3-4 posts per week, with flexibility to post 5x during high-value weeks (conferences, major regulatory announcements, hot industry topics).

**Engagement evolution:** Continue 30-60 minutes daily, but shift focus from broad engagement to **strategic relationship building**. Identify 20-30 key executives whose content you comment on consistently. Form engagement group with 8-12 other banking/risk/compliance professionals for reciprocal support. When posting, tag 1-2 relevant people (not spammy) who would find value or could add perspective.

**Content refinement based on month 1-3 data:**
- Analyze top 10 posts by impressions and engagement—what patterns emerge?
- Double down on winning formats (e.g., if carousels with TPRM frameworks crush, create more)
- Identify underperforming themes and either improve or reduce frequency
- Test new content types: short video (60-second insights filmed on phone), LinkedIn polls with industry questions, LinkedIn Live or audio events

**Advanced content techniques:**

**Contrarian series:** "Unpopular opinions in bank risk management"

- First 1-2 speaking opportunities or media requests
- Measurable business impact (consulting inquiry, speaking invitation, partnership discussion)

### Content generation system: Creating 52 high-quality posts in 6 months

**The challenge:** Maintaining novelty without repetition across 52-75 posts. **The solution:** Topic clustering, content recycling, and systematic ideation.

**Topic clustering approach:**

Each pillar (TPRM Excellence, M&A Integration, Compliance with Limited Resources, Regulatory Navigation, Leadership) contains 8-12 subtopics. Each subtopic generates 3-5 posts from different angles.

**Example: TPRM Excellence pillar → Vendor onboarding subtopic**

Post 1: "The 5 vendor onboarding mistakes that create downstream risk" (listicle)
Post 2: "How we reduced vendor onboarding from 90 days to 30 days" (case study with metrics)
Post 3: "Why your vendor onboarding checklist is probably incomplete" (contrarian take)
Post 4: "The onboarding question that predicts vendor problems" (single insight)
Post 5: "Vendor onboarding at scale: From 50 to 200 vendors annually" (war story)

**Same core expertise, five completely different posts.** This approach prevents repetition while reinforcing authority on the subtopic.

**Content recycling strategies:**

**The Content Multiplication Framework:**
1. **Deep dive post** (1,500 words on LinkedIn) → Single comprehensive post
2. **Extract insights** → 5 single-insight posts over 5 weeks
3. **Visual framework** → Carousel post with same content repackaged
4. **Video summary** → 60-second video hitting key points
5. **Newsletter edition** → Expanded version with additional resources
6. **Poll/engagement** → "Which of these 5 approaches works best for you?"

One substantial piece of analysis generates 6+ distinct LinkedIn posts across different formats and timeframes.

**The Weekly Ideation System:**

**Monday content planning session (30 minutes):**
- Review last week's post performance—what resonated?
- Check industry news (American Banker, ABA, regulatory announcements)
- Identify 1-2 hot topics worth addressing
- Mine personal experiences from previous week
- Draft 4 post concepts for current week

**Tuesday batch creation (2 hours):**
- Write 3-4 posts for the week
- Create visuals for carousel posts
- Schedule using LinkedIn native scheduler or Buffer/Hootsuite
- Leave 1 slot open for real-time reactive content

**Wednesday-Friday execution:**
- Publish scheduled content
- Engage 30-60 minutes daily
- Monitor post performance
- Respond to all comments within first 90 minutes

**Content ideation prompts to overcome writer's block:**

For TPRM content: What vendor issue did we encounter this month? What question did a peer ask recently? What regulatory guidance just dropped? What's everyone doing wrong in vendor risk? What's a framework I use that others might not know?

For M&A content: What integration challenge surprised me? What would I tell my past self before our last merger? What do acquirers consistently underestimate? What does the board not understand about integration timelines? What's the unsexy operational work that determines M&A success?

For compliance efficiency: What manual process did we automate? What did we stop doing that didn't matter? Where do most banks waste compliance resources? What's the 80/20 of compliance effectiveness? How did we demonstrate ROI to leadership?

For regulatory content: What's the practical implication of recent guidance? What are examiners actually looking for? What common regulatory misinterpretation do I see? What's changing in the examination approach? How do we manage multiple regulatory relationships?

For leadership content: What difficult conversation did I have this week? What mistake taught me something valuable? What's the career advice I wish I'd received? How do I manage competing priorities? What's the reality of VP-level risk management versus the perception?

**The 4-week content rotation:**

Week 1 themes: Frameworks and how-to (educational, high value)
Week 2 themes: War stories and case studies (entertainment + education)
Week 3 themes: Contrarian takes and myth-busting (thought-provoking)
Week 4 themes: Industry trends and forward-looking (strategic perspective)

Rotating weekly themes ensures variety while maintaining systematic approach.

**Balancing pillar versus satellite content:**

**Pillar content (30% of posts):** Deep, comprehensive posts on core expertise areas. Long-form (1,500+ characters), richly formatted, data-driven. These are "signature posts" establishing authority. Examples: Major frameworks, original research, comprehensive guides, controversial well-argued takes.

**Satellite content (70% of posts):** Supporting posts that reinforce pillar themes from different angles. Shorter, more varied, easier to create. Examples: Single insights, quick tips, personal anecdotes, questions, reactions to news, engagement posts, behind-the-scenes.

Pillar content generates depth and authority. Satellite content maintains visibility and engagement between pillar posts. Together, they create comprehensive coverage without burnout.

## Risk management for controversial takes

Trevor's role at a regulated financial institution requires careful navigation when challenging conventional wisdom. **The framework: Provoke thought, not controversy. Challenge ideas, not people or institutions.**

**Green zone (safe controversy):**
- Challenging common practices with evidence: "Most banks approach vendor risk backward—here's why"
- Myth-busting with data: "The TPRM metric everyone tracks that doesn't actually predict risk"
- Alternative frameworks: "Why we abandoned [common approach] for [better approach]"
- Questioning assumptions: "What if regulatory compliance isn't the goal, but the baseline?"
- Practical skepticism: "Why most M&A integrations fail (and what the 17% who succeed do differently)"

**Yellow zone (proceed with caution):**
- Regulatory interpretation: Focus on "what this means for you" versus criticizing regulators
- Vendor criticism: Discuss categories/approaches, not specific companies
- Industry problems: Frame as "we all face this" not "other banks are failing"
- Bank failures/issues: Extract lessons without naming institutions unless already public
- Technology hype: Question approaches, not specific vendors by name

**Red zone (avoid):**
- Criticizing regulators, specific banks, or competitors by name
- Discussing confidential information or client/employer specifics
- Political opinions unrelated to banking policy
- Personal attacks or aggressive language
- Unsubstantiated claims or speculation
- Discussing pending litigation or enforcement actions
- Sharing proprietary data or methodologies without permission

**Safe framing techniques:**

Instead of "Bank X failed because they ignored vendor risk," use "Recent industry events highlight why vendor concentration risk matters."

Instead of "Regulators don't understand real-world constraints," use "Here's how we interpret new guidance for practical implementation."

Instead of "Vendor Y's solution is ineffective," use "When evaluating TPRM technology, here are the gaps to watch for."

**The "compliment sandwich" for controversial takes:**
1. Acknowledge the conventional wisdom and why it exists
2. Present the contrarian view with evidence and reasoning
3. Offer a constructive alternative approach

Example: "Comprehensive vendor risk assessments are the industry standard for good reason—they demonstrate diligence. But after managing TPRM programs at scale, I've seen how they can become compliance theater that misses actual risk. What if we shifted from comprehensive to proportional risk assessment, focusing deep diligence on the 20% of vendors who could cause material harm?"

**Pre-publication checklist for controversial content:**
- Could this be misinterpreted as criticizing employer or clients? (Revise)
- Does this include confidential or proprietary information? (Remove)
- Am I criticizing specific institutions or people? (Generalize or remove)
- Is this claim backed by data, experience, or reasoning? (Add support or soften claim)
- Would I say this in front of regulators or at a conference? (If no, reconsider)
- Does this advance the conversation or just vent frustration? (Ensure value-add)

**When backlash occurs:**
- Pause before responding (24-hour rule for heated reactions)
- Acknowledge valid concerns professionally
- Clarify intent if misunderstood (not defensive, but explanatory)
- Stand by evidence-based positions while remaining open to discussion
- Avoid getting drawn into unproductive arguments
- Learn from feedback to refine future controversial takes

The goal: Be known for challenging conventional wisdom thoughtfully, not for being contrarian for attention.

### What engagement rates actually mean

**Poor performance: <2%** - Content not resonating, algorithm not amplifying, audience mismatch, or weak hooks/value proposition. Action: Review content quality, format variety, and engagement strategy.

**Average: 2-3%** - Baseline acceptable performance. Building foundation but not breaking through. Action: Identify top performers and replicate those patterns.

**Good: 3-5%** - Content resonating with audience, algorithm amplifying reach, thought leadership emerging. Action: Scale what's working, increase posting consistency.

**Excellent: 5-7%** - Strong thought leadership established, highly engaged audience, premium content quality. Action: Maintain quality, explore monetization opportunities.

**Outstanding: 7-10%+** - Top-tier performance, recognized expert status, exceptional audience connection. Action: Leverage for business development, speaking, partnerships.

**Context matters:** Small accounts (\<5K followers) naturally achieve higher engagement percentages. Large accounts trade percentage for absolute reach. A post with 10,000 impressions at 3% engagement (300 total engagements) outperforms a post with 2,000 impressions at 6% engagement (120 total engagements) in terms of absolute visibility and business impact.

### Impressions versus followers: What matters for Trevor

**Impressions matter more.** Here's why: Only 8-10% of followers see any given post on average. Trevor could have 5,000 followers but if only 400-500 see each post due to algorithm, a smaller account with higher engagement might achieve greater reach. Small accounts generate 16 impressions per 100 followers per post, while large accounts see just 3 impressions per 100 followers per post.

**Optimal strategy:** Focus on **engagement rate × impression reach** as combined metric. High engagement (comments, shares, meaningful interactions) signals algorithm to amplify reach. Reach amplification attracts quality followers. Quality followers drive business impact.

**Follower count still matters for:** Social proof (10,000+ followers signals established authority), amplification potential ceiling (more followers increase viral post potential), credibility signaling (speaking invitations, media opportunities correlate with follower count), and network effects (larger network increases serendipitous connections).

**Trevor's measurement priority:**
1. **Primary:** Engagement rate (3-5%+ target) - indicates content resonance
2. **Secondary:** Monthly impression growth (20-30% month-over-month early stage) - measures reach expansion
3. **Tertiary:** Follower growth from target audience (quality over quantity) - builds network
4. **Ultimate:** Business impact (leads, opportunities, revenue) - validates ROI

### Measuring "awareness" and "authority" beyond vanity metrics

**Awareness (How many know Trevor exists):**

Quantitative signals:
- Profile views per week trending upward over 90 days
- Search appearances (how often Trevor appears in LinkedIn searches for "TPRM expert," "bank risk management")
- Content reach beyond network (percentage of impressions from 2nd/3rd degree connections)
- Newsletter subscriber growth (more valuable than followers—direct access)
- Follower growth from non-1st degree connections

Qualitative signals:
- Inbound connection requests from ideal customer profile (CROs, VPs of Compliance, CEOs at regional banks)
- "I've been following your content" messages from high-value contacts
- Speaking invitations to webinars, podcasts, conferences
- Media requests from American Banker, Bank Director, trade publications
- Being mentioned or tagged by others in industry discussions

**Authority (How much they trust Trevor's expertise):**

Quantitative signals:
- Comment quality score (substantive multi-sentence comments versus "great post")
- Share rate (shares indicate "worth recommending to my network")
- Profile views from decision-makers (track seniority and job function of viewers)
- Engagement from ICP (percentage of total engagement from target audience)
- Content saves (LinkedIn save feature indicates reference value)
- Click-through rates on links to resources, frameworks, guides
- Conversion metrics (newsletter sign-ups, content downloads, meeting requests)

Qualitative signals:
- Quality of comment conversations (deep, substantive threads versus surface reactions)
- Who engages (C-suite and industry leaders commenting versus random audience)
- Recommendation requests ("Can you speak at our conference about X?")
- Citation and reference (others using Trevor's frameworks or ideas in their content)
- Partnership opportunities (collaboration requests, joint content creation)
- Customer attribution ("I reached out because of your LinkedIn content")

**Measurement framework (monthly review):**

**Reach tier:** Profile views, impressions, follower growth - measures awareness expansion

**Resonance tier:** Engagement rate, comment quality, share rate - measures content interest

**Reputation tier:** Who engages, speaking invitations, media mentions - measures credibility signals

**Revenue tier:** Leads generated, consulting inquiries, deals influenced - measures business impact

Early months (1-6) focus heavily on Reach and Resonance. Later months (6-12) shift toward Reputation and Revenue as compounding returns emerge.

### Timeline reality check: How long does this actually take?

**Honest answer: 6-12 months minimum for measurable business impact. 12-24 months for recognized thought leadership.**

**Phase 1: Foundation (Months 0-3)** - Building posting muscle, finding voice, establishing consistency. Expected results: 200-1,000 followers, 2-3% engagement, 5,000-8,000 monthly impressions. Business impact minimal but foundation setting. Time investment: 4-6 hours weekly.

**Phase 2: Traction (Months 4-6)** - Identifying what resonates, refining content strategy, building strategic relationships. Expected results: 500-2,000 followers, 3-4% engagement, 10,000-15,000 monthly impressions, 1-3 quality inbound inquiries monthly. First leads beginning to appear. Time investment: 5-8 hours weekly.

**Phase 3: Growth (Months 7-12)** - Scaling what works, establishing authority, generating consistent business impact. Expected results: 1,000-5,000 followers, 4-5% engagement, 20,000-40,000 monthly impressions, 5-10 quality inquiries monthly, first deals closing. Measurable ROI emerging. Time investment: 6-10 hours weekly.

**Phase 4: Established thought leader (Months 13-24)** - Maintaining leadership, leveraging speaking opportunities, compounding returns. Expected results: 5,000-10,000+ followers, 5%+ sustained engagement, 50,000-100,000+ monthly impressions, consistent pipeline generation, regular speaking invitations. Significant measurable revenue contribution. Time investment: 6-8 hours weekly (more efficient at scale).

**Critical insight:** No one becomes a recognized thought leader in 90 days. Those claiming "10,000 followers in 30 days" either bought followers, had existing audiences, or define "thought leadership" as follower count rather than business impact. Genuine authority requires sustained effort, consistent value delivery, and time for compounding network effects.

**Case study timelines for reference:**
- Dan Sanchez: 16 months to 10,000+ followers with intensive effort (daily posting, 1.5 hours daily engagement)
- Luvleen Sidhu: 7-10 years building influence parallel to company growth
- Jim Marous: 10+ years to top-5 industry influencer status
- Chris Skinner: 15-20 years of daily blogging to industry-defining authority

Trevor's realistic 6-month goal: 500-2,000 quality followers, 10,000-15,000 monthly impressions, 4%+ engagement rate, 3-10 monthly quality inquiries, emerging recognition among banking risk professionals. This positions him strongly for accelerated growth in months 7-12 and established thought leadership by 18-24 months.

## Advanced tactics for months 4-6 and beyond

### Creating "viral" breakthrough posts

Most thought leadership doesn't require viral posts—consistent quality beats occasional virality. However, strategic breakthrough posts accelerate awareness. **Viral post characteristics in B2B banking:**

**Data-driven surprising insights:** "I analyzed 50 bank M&A deals over 5 years. 83% failed to achieve integration goals. Here's the pattern no one talks about." Posts with original data analysis generate exceptional engagement.

**Contrarian takes with evidence:** "Unpopular opinion: Your comprehensive vendor risk assessments are missing the actual risk. Here's why." Challenging conventional wisdom (backed by reasoning) sparks discussion and shares.

**Timely regulatory interpretation:** When new OCC, FDIC, or Fed guidance drops, being first with practical interpretation for regional banks creates massive value. "The new OCC third-party risk guidance just dropped. Here's what it actually means for $3-10B banks."

**Personal vulnerable stories:** "The day I almost got fired for an M&A integration mistake—and the lesson that saved my career." Authentic vulnerability with professional lessons generates emotional connection and massive engagement.

**Frameworks that solve real problems:** "After managing TPRM at 3 banks through 5 M&As, here's the only vendor integration framework you need." Actionable IP shared generously builds authority.

**Breakthrough post formula:**
- Hook must stop scroll in first 150 characters
- Content must deliver genuine novel value
- Format should be highly shareable (carousel, long-form story, data visualization)
- Post at optimal time (Tuesday/Wednesday 8-10 AM)
- Engage heavily in first 90 minutes to signal algorithm
- Tag 1-2 highly relevant people who would find value (not spammy)
- Consider: Strategic boost with LinkedIn ads for breakthrough posts

### Building strategic partnerships

**Co-creating content with complementary experts:** Identify professionals in adjacent domains (fintech, RegTech, banking technology, bank M&A advisors, compliance consultants) for collaborative content. "Trevor Kavanaugh (TPRM expert) and [Fintech CEO] discuss: The future of vendor risk management technology." Tag each other, cross-promote to both audiences, mutual credibility boost.

**Expert roundup posts:** "I asked 10 CROs at regional banks: What's your #1 TPRM challenge in 2025? Here's what they said." Feature quotes from 8-12 industry leaders. Tag them all. They'll likely engage and share, amplifying reach massively.

**Guest contributions:** Offer to write guest posts for American Banker, Bank Director, ABA Banking Journal, BAI. Share published articles on LinkedIn with key takeaways and "Link in comments for full article." Media placement + LinkedIn amplification = authority multiplier.

**Podcast circuit:** Pitch to be guest on banking podcasts (Banking Transformed, Breaking Banks, Bank Tech, Fintech Insider). Each appearance generates content: "Just recorded episode with [Podcast] about TPRM challenges. Here are 3 insights from our conversation." Include 30-second video clip if possible.

### LinkedIn Newsletter strategy

Launch LinkedIn Newsletter by month 4-5 once content themes are established. **Why newsletters matter:** Direct inbox access (not subject to algorithm), higher perceived value (subscribers versus followers), convertible to email list, credibility signal (newsletter author status), content repurposing vehicle (best LinkedIn posts expanded).

**Newsletter structure:**
- **Frequency:** Biweekly or monthly (sustainable, high quality)
- **Format:** 800-1,500 words expanding on best-performing LinkedIn posts
- **Sections:** Opening insight, framework or case study, practical application, action items, quick hits (industry news)
- **Promotion:** Tease newsletter content in regular LinkedIn posts: "This week's newsletter deep-dives into TPRM automation. Subscribe to get full framework."

**Newsletter title options for Trevor:**
- "Risk Management Reality" (practical insights from the trenches)
- "The TPRM Report" (focused on vendor risk management)
- "Banking Risk Insider" (broad banking risk coverage)
- "Compliance Without Complexity" (efficiency focus)

### Expanding to other content formats

**Short-form video (60-90 seconds):** Film on phone with natural lighting. Vertical format. Subtitles essential. Topics: "60-second TPRM tip," "Quick take on [regulatory news]," "War story Wednesday," "Framework Friday." Video posts receive 5.60% engagement rate and are most shared content type.

**LinkedIn Live or Audio Events:** Host quarterly 30-minute "Ask Me Anything" sessions on TPRM, M&A integration, or compliance efficiency. Promotes engagement, positions as accessible expert, generates content (recap posts, clips, quotes).

**Document posts/carousels:** Create multi-slide frameworks in PowerPoint/Canva. 5-10 slides optimal, 25-50 words per slide, 1080x1080 pixels, strong hook on slide 1, clear progression, final slide with CTA. Carousel posts achieve 1.6x average reach—highest performing format. Topics: "The 7-Stage Vendor Onboarding Framework," "M&A Integration Timeline: What to Expect When," "Regulatory Compliance Prioritization Matrix."

**Long-form LinkedIn Articles:** 1,900-2,000 word articles on core expertise topics. Published directly to LinkedIn (doesn't hurt reach like external links). Provides "published author" credibility. Topics: Comprehensive guides, industry analyses, original research findings, controversial opinion pieces with extensive supporting evidence.

### Tracking competitive intelligence

**Monitor these thought leaders' content:**
- Jim Marous: Digital banking transformation approaches
- Ron Shevlin: Contrarian fintech takes and what generates discussion
- Chris Skinner: Long-term trend positioning
- McKinsey Banking Practice: Data-driven insights style
- Oliver Wyman Risk Experts: CRO-focused content

**What to track:**
- Which topics generate highest engagement for them
- Format choices and performance patterns
- How they frame controversial takes
- Their posting frequency and timing
- Comment section dynamics (what sparks discussion)

**Adaptation strategy:** Don't copy—differentiate. If Jim Marous posts about digital transformation, Trevor posts about "The digital transformation risks everyone ignores (and how to manage them)." Complementary perspective, not competitive.

### Scaling with sustainability

**Burnout prevention:** Thought leadership is marathon, not sprint. **Sustainable strategies:**

**Batch creation efficiency:** Dedicate one 3-hour session every 2 weeks creating 6-8 posts. Schedule all at once. Frees daily time for engagement only.

**Repurpose ruthlessly:** Turn client presentations into LinkedIn carousels (sanitized). Transform internal frameworks into posts. Convert conference talk into 5-post series. Mine old emails for insights shared with peers.

**Engagement shortcuts:** Use LinkedIn's "Recent Activity" feature to see what your connections are posting (efficient targeting). Set up notifications for key people's posts (be first to comment). Focus engagement on Tuesday-Thursday (highest ROI days).

**Theme weeks:** "TPRM week" (4 posts on vendor risk), "M&A week" (3-4 integration posts), "Regulatory week" (compliance and examination content). Easier to batch-create related content than jumping between topics.

**Vacation strategy:** Schedule 2 weeks of content before vacation. Reduce posting to 2x weekly during vacation. Use LinkedIn scheduler. Don't apologize for reduced frequency—quality over quantity always.

### When to consider paid promotion

**Organic reach should be priority for first 6 months.** After establishing content-market fit and identifying top-performing posts, strategic paid promotion accelerates growth.

**LinkedIn Thought Leader Ads** (available to executives): 1.7x higher click-through rate, 1.6x higher engagement, 4x engagement for C-suite with TL ads. Cost: $10-30 per day for meaningful reach. **When to use:** Promote breakthrough posts (frameworks, original research, viral candidates), amplify speaking announcements or media features, boost newsletter launch posts, target specific decision-makers at specific companies.

**Promotion budget suggestion:** $250-500 monthly (months 7-12) promoting top 2-3 posts monthly. Focus on posts demonstrating clear expertise (frameworks, data-driven insights) over personal stories. Target: Banking executives, VPs of Risk/Compliance, CROs, at institutions $1B-50B in assets, in key geographic markets.

## Conclusion: Your 6-month roadmap

Trevor's path to recognized thought leadership follows proven patterns: **consistency, value delivery, strategic engagement, and patience**. The first 90 days build posting muscles and identify what resonates. Months 4-6 double down on winners and scale strategically. By month 6, realistic targets include 500-2,000 quality followers, 10,000-15,000 monthly impressions, 4%+ engagement rate, and 3-10 monthly quality inquiries.

Success requires 30-60 minutes daily engagement (commenting, responding, relationship-building) plus 2-3 hours weekly content creation. This 6-10 hour weekly investment compounds over time. **Business impact emerges months 4-6, becomes measurable months 7-12, and compounds significantly in year 2.**

Trevor's competitive advantage—practitioner expertise at the intersection of TPRM, M&A integration, compliance efficiency, and regulatory navigation—positions him uniquely. Senior banking executives desperately need peer perspectives from someone who's solved these problems at scale. Most content comes from consultants selling or vendors pitching. Trevor offers authentic war stories, proven frameworks, and contrarian insights backed by experience.

The formula: **Consistency** (3-4 quality posts weekly) × **Value** (genuine insights solving audience problems) × **Engagement** (building relationships, not broadcasting) × **Time** (6-12 months minimum) = **Recognized Thought Leadership**.

Start Monday. Optimize profile. Batch-create first 10 posts. Engage 30 minutes daily. Measure weekly. Adjust monthly. Persist through months when growth feels slow. Trust the compounding process.

By month 6, Trevor won't just have impressive metrics—he'll have transformed perception from "VP at a regional bank" to "the expert voice on TPRM and banking risk management." Speaking invitations will arrive. Media will request commentary. Consulting inquiries will increase. Most importantly, Trevor will have built a sustainable platform for long-term career leverage, business development, and industry impact.

The opportunity is clear. The playbook is proven. Execution starts now.
