# KPMG Just Priced AI-Augmented Auditing

KPMG just told the market what AI-augmented auditing is worth: 14% less than last year. That's not just a procurement win for one firm. It's a market signal that will ripple through every vendor relationship where audit, assurance, or professional services fees are on the table.

The implications extend well beyond KPMG's books. When a Big Four firm publicly stakes a position on what AI does to service pricing, they're creating a reference point that procurement teams everywhere will use. And that creates pressure that cuts in directions nobody's fully mapped out yet.

## The News

KPMG International negotiated a 14% fee reduction from its auditor, Grant Thornton UK, for its 2025 audit. The argument: AI makes audit work cheaper, so pass on the savings.

The fee dropped from $416,000 to $357,000. KPMG threatened to switch auditors if Grant Thornton didn't comply.

This was filed at UK Companies House. Public record. Anyone can see it.

## Why This Isn't Just a Procurement Win

KPMG didn't just negotiate a discount. They filed a valuation.

Every CFO and procurement team now has a market reference price—a comp—for what a Big Four firm believes AI-assisted audit services are worth. And it's 14% lower than last year, during a period when audit fees have been *rising* across Europe as firms invest in AI infrastructure.

That's not a negotiation. That's a market signal.

For anyone managing vendor relationships involving professional services—audit, assurance, consulting, advisory—this creates an anchor. When your vendor says AI doesn't change their pricing, you now have a documented counterexample from one of the most sophisticated buyers in the market.

## Two Futures, Same Technology

Here's where it gets complicated.

**Scenario one: Healthy repricing.** The audit market has been overpriced for years. AI handles the rote work—transaction testing, document review, pattern matching—while humans focus on judgment-heavy areas. Efficiency gains create genuine competition. Fees come down. Quality stays the same or improves.

This is the optimistic case. Technology absorbs the mechanical work, and the humans who remain do the parts that require actual expertise.

**Scenario two: Degraded quality via economic pressure.** Lower fees mean lower margins. Lower margins mean firms cut the expensive part—human expertise. AI gets used not to augment judgment but to replace it, because the economics no longer support having experienced auditors do the work. The "human in the loop" becomes a rubber stamp on AI-generated workpapers.

We've seen this pattern before in other industries. When fee pressure compresses margins below the level required to maintain quality, firms have three choices: exit the market, accept lower margins, or cut corners.

We don't know which future we're getting.

## Grant Thornton's Response Is the Tell

Their statement: "High-quality audits rely heavily on expert human judgment, so our fees reflect both the cost of our people and the cost of the technology that supports them."

Translation: Quality requires humans. Humans cost money. When fees compress, something gives.

KPMG's own hedging is notable too: "While it is true AI can create efficiencies, developing and operating AI systems can generate additional costs."

Even they're not claiming this is pure savings.

## The Question Nobody's Answering

The question isn't whether AI can make auditing more efficient. It can.

The question is whether the fee pressure KPMG just legitimized will let firms invest in doing it right—or whether it creates a race to the bottom where AI coverage substitutes for professional judgment.

This matters for everyone who relies on audit reports. When you receive a SOC 2 or a financial statement audit, you're trusting that someone with expertise actually examined the evidence and exercised judgment. If the economics push auditors toward AI-generated workpapers with minimal human review, that trust becomes hollow.

Audit failures don't announce themselves in advance. They surface years later, after the damage is done.

> "When procurement pressure meets professional judgment, which one wins?"

KPMG just gave us the opening data point. The answer to that question will take years to become clear—and by then, the market will have moved.
