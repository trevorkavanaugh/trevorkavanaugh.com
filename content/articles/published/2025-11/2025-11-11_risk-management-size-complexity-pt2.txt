Topic: Risk Management Commensurate with Size and Complexity (Part 2)
Date: 11/11/2025

I keep seeing two types of institutions: ones that think a $10B bank needs a $100B program, and ones that think a $5B program is good enough.

Both are wrong. Here's why.

A few weeks ago I posted about the $10B regulatory wall and why your TPRM program doesn't need to look like JPMorgan's. This isn't contradicting that — but it is adding nuance. The risks of under-engineering can be just as catastrophic as over-engineering.

TD Bank learned this the hard way. Their $13.4 billion First Horizon acquisition — the largest bank deal in recent history — died in 2023 after regulators found their BSA/AML program hadn't scaled with their growth. The OCC was damning: TD "pursued growth" without a compliance program "commensurate with its risk profile."

The cost? $225 million breakup fee. $3.09 billion in penalties. An asset cap that killed future growth.

This isn't an outlier. M&T Bank's Hudson City acquisition took 39 months to close while regulators forced compliance rebuilding—Hudson City lost 28% of deposits waiting. BancorpSouth was frozen out of M&A entirely for 3+ years due to BSA/AML and CRA issues. Between 2009-2012, 233 bank merger applications were withdrawn due to compliance deficiencies.

Regulators call this 'commensurate with'—programs must match your size, complexity, and risk profile. It appears in every enforcement action.

💡 So what's the answer?

United Bankshares: 34 acquisitions, no major delays. They built infrastructure that doesn't slow them down.
It's not regulatory floor vs. gold-plating—there's an optimal band in between. And it depends entirely on where you're headed, not just where you are.

The way I think about it: current size + growth over 2-3 years + any planned M&A. That's your target.

So a $10B bank growing 15% annually? You'll be around $14.5B in three years — build for that. An $8B bank planning a $4B acquisition is really a $12B+ institution once the deal closes, so build for $14B capabilities now. But a $10B bank with no growth plans? Stay at $10B. Right-sized is right.

⏳ When should you actually build ahead?

If you're growing 10%+ annually and will hit the next regulatory threshold in 2-3 years, you're better off building now than scrambling later when examiners are already looking.

If M&A is part of your strategy, regulatory scrutiny during deal review is real—and regulators explicitly look for programs that match your ambitions, not just your current state.

Being ahead gives you credibility when opportunities come up.

⭐ Your job shouldn't be remediating findings — it should be staying ahead of them.

Where's your institution headed? That should determine your risk management investment today.
