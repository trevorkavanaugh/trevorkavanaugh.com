Topic: Transparency with Auditors and Regulators (Part 1)
Date: 11/18/2025

When auditors and regulators discover a control gap you didn't disclose, there are only two interpretations: You're not competent enough to identify your own problems, or you were hiding them.

Both are worse than transparency.

I spent two years in internal audit before returning to risk management. The biggest thing that surprised me during that time? Every business unit I walked into to audit seemed scared of me.

But I was really just there to help.

That fear? It shows up in every audit and exam I've seen since. And it costs banks credibility they don't realize they're losing.

⏰ Here's what actually happens when you don't disclose known control gaps:

Your auditors and examiners have 40-60 hours to assess your entire program. Every hour they spend rediscovering issues you already identified is an hour they're not spending finding the gaps you missed.

Staying quiet doesn't protect you. It just wastes their time and signals one of two things: Either your internal monitoring isn't mature enough to catch problems, or you knew and chose not to say anything.

Neither builds trust.

💡 From the auditor and examiner side of the table, I can tell you what credibility looks like:

It's not a perfect program. It's self-awareness.

Walk in with documented gaps, what caused them, and your remediation timeline — that's what credibility looks like. You're showing them a risk function that can identify and address issues on its own.

When they have to discover everything themselves? That's the opposite signal.

Banks that treat examiners and auditors as adversaries waste everyone's time. The ones that treat them as quality assurance reviews get better findings.

Your auditors and examiners aren't there to catch you. They're there because they have more time than you do to find problems in your program — and that's valuable if you let it be.

This isn't about making examiners happy. It's about using their time well and showing you can identify problems on your own.

The control gaps are getting found either way. You're just choosing how you want to look when they do.


What's been your experience with audit and examination transparency? Have you seen this dynamic play out differently?
