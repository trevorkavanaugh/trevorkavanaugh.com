Topic: Vendor Portfolio Concentration Optimization
Date: 11/27/2025

Post-CrowdStrike, everyone's instinct is to diversify vendor concentrations.

That instinct has costs nobody's calculating.

Vendor concentration works like an investment portfolio. Diversification reduces risk — until it doesn't. Over-diversify and you're paying transaction costs, losing returns, and creating complexity that becomes its own risk.

Same with vendors.

🔴 Over-concentration (the risk everyone talks about):

One critical vendor handles most of your outsourcing. They fail or get breached — material impact across the institution. No fallback, no leverage, complete dependency.

CrowdStrike made this real for a lot of banks this year.

🔴 Under-concentration (the risk nobody talks about):

20 vendors doing 20 things that could be 5 vendors doing 20 things. Now you've got integration complexity between systems that don't talk to each other. Data silos across platforms. No vendor owning problems end-to-end. 20 contracts, 20 renewals, 20 relationship managers. More surface area, not less risk.

🔴 Fourth-party concentration (the risk you can't see):

Your vendors look diversified. But half of them use the same cloud provider, the same payroll processor, the same authentication service. One fourth-party incident ripples across your "diversified" portfolio.

You didn't reduce concentration. You just hid it one layer down.

💡 The optimization isn't "minimize concentration." It's finding the right balance for your risk appetite.

Questions that actually matter: Which vendors could cause material harm if they failed tomorrow? Where does apparent diversification mask shared dependencies? What's the real cost of fragmentation you're tolerating to avoid concentration?

Concentration risk isn't a dial you turn to zero. It's a portfolio you manage.


What's been your experience — have you seen fragmentation create as many problems as concentration?
