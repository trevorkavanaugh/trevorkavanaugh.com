Topic: Development of Third-Party Risk (Part 2)
Date: 12/23/2025

Last week we talked about how vendors aren't the unit of risk — products and services are. But even that doesn't go deep enough.

Two products that do the exact same thing can have vastly different risk profiles. The difference isn't what they do. It's how they're built, delivered, and hosted.

🔴 The layers beneath the product

When you assess a SaaS product, you're usually evaluating what it does. Does it handle sensitive data? Does it integrate with critical systems? That's the starting point.

But underneath that product are decisions the vendor made that you probably never asked about — and each one carries risk you're not seeing.

Supply chain — what's in the product

Every modern application is built on dependencies. Open source libraries, third-party components, code the vendor didn't write but shipped anyway. Log4j proved what happens when one compromised dependency ripples across thousands of products overnight.

One vendor built lean. Another pulled in everything. Same functionality. Completely different exposure. You'd never know from a feature comparison.

Software delivery — how it gets updated

How does that product get patched? Automatic updates you can't control? Manual releases you have to schedule? A CI/CD pipeline that pushes code daily?

Each model carries different risk. SolarWinds wasn't a product failure — it was a delivery pipeline failure. The product worked fine. The update was poisoned. A compromised update mechanism turns routine patching into an attack vector.

Cloud outsourcing — where it runs

One product runs on dedicated infrastructure with redundancy across regions. Another runs on shared cloud resources in a single availability zone. Same application layer. Completely different resilience.

One vendor's outage is an inconvenience. The other's is a business disruption.

⚠️ Residual risk lives below the surface

You assess inherent risk based on what a product does — data access, integration points, business criticality.

But residual risk depends on how the vendor built it, maintains it, and hosts it.

Two products with identical inherent risk can carry vastly different residual risk based on decisions made in layers your due diligence never reached.

💡 The questions most assessments miss

Your vendor questionnaire probably asks what the product does. Does it ask:

→ What dependencies are embedded in your codebase, and how do you monitor them for vulnerabilities?
→ How do you secure your build and deployment pipeline?
→ Where does this run, and what's the redundancy model?

If not, you're assessing the surface and missing what's underneath.


When's the last time your due diligence went below the application layer?
