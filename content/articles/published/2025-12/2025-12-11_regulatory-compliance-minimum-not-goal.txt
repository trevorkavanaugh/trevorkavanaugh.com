Topic: Treat Regulatory Compliance as the Minimum, Not the Goal
Date: 12/11/2025

Compliance with regulatory guidance should be the baseline, not the goal line.

Most institutions treat full compliance like a finish line. But by aiming for it instead of past it, they rarely actually get there. Momentum slows as they approach. Resources shift elsewhere. And then new guidance drops while they're still catching up on the last round.

Now they're playing catchup on two fronts. That game isn't sustainable. It's a ticking time bomb.

🔴 The pattern nobody talks about

Bank aims for compliance. Gets close enough. Moves on. New guidance comes out. Bank is already behind before they start. Repeat.

Each cycle compounds. The gap between where you are and where you should be widens. And examiners notice the pattern long before you do.

⚠️ We've outsourced our risk management to regulators

Here's what bothers me about the "compliance is the goal" mindset — it assumes regulators are leading and we're following.

But regulators don't write guidance for fun. They're identifying control gaps across the banks they examine. They're spotting trends in fraud, money laundering, consumer harm. They publish guidance because enough institutions failed to figure it out themselves.

When we wait for guidance to tell us what to fix, we've outsourced the risk identification function to our regulators. They're playing risk manager for us. We're just implementing their findings.

Is that what being a risk management professional means? Following guidance? Or should we be identifying the gaps before guidance codifies them?

📋 The institutions that get this right

The banks that operate above the regulatory baseline aren't gold-plating. They're building buffer room.

When new guidance drops, they're already partially there. They're adjusting, not scrambling. They're refining programs, not building them from scratch under examiner scrutiny.

They treat guidance as confirmation of direction, not revelation of what to do next.

💡 The question worth asking

Are we risk management professionals — or guidance followers?

If your program strategy is "wait for regulators to tell us what needs to change," you're not managing risk. You're administering compliance.

The regulators shouldn't be the ones discovering the control gaps. That's supposed to be our job.


What's your experience — does your institution aim past guidance or just toward it?
