# Software Supply Chain Visibility

Your vendors assemble software from components with no contracts, no warranties, no corporate accountability behind them. We've covered that reality. The question is: now what?

The answer starts with asking different questions—and understanding why some vendors can answer them while others can't.

## The Question No One Asks

We ask vendors about security policies. SOC 2 reports. Incident response plans. Penetration testing.

We don't ask: **what's actually in your software?**

Not features—components. The libraries and dependencies they assembled their product from. The building blocks underneath the application you're relying on for critical operations.

Most vendors have never been asked this question. Many couldn't answer it if they were. They know what their software does. They often don't have a complete inventory of what it's made of.

## You've Already Seen This Pattern

One vulnerability drops. Half your vendors go quiet.

That silence isn't malice—it's a **visibility gap**. They're not ignoring you. They're scrambling to answer a question they've never had to answer before: what's actually in our code, and are we affected?

Some vendors respond in hours. They already knew what was in their software because they'd invested in knowing before it mattered. They had systems in place to map their dependencies, track their components, and quickly determine exposure when a new vulnerability emerged.

Others take weeks. Not because they don't care—because they're building that visibility in real-time, during a crisis, while you wait. They're doing the inventory work they should have done beforehand, except now they're doing it under pressure with your risk hanging in the balance.

Log4j in 2021 was the obvious example. But the pattern repeats with every major vulnerability disclosure. The vendors who knew responded fast. The vendors who didn't went dark while they figured it out.

## What Separates Them

Vendors who built their software recently usually have this visibility by default. Modern development practices make tracking dependencies easier from the start. When you build with current tooling, maintaining a software bill of materials is often built into the workflow.

Vendors running older systems they've maintained for years? That visibility takes real investment to add after the fact. You're reverse-engineering a codebase that's evolved over time, often with limited documentation about what got added when. Some vendors have made that investment. Many haven't.

This isn't always negligence. Legacy codebases are genuinely hard. Technical debt accumulates. Resources are constrained. But the outcome for you is the same—you either get an answer, or you don't.

## The Difference Worth Knowing

The vendors who respond quickly aren't necessarily the ones with the biggest security budgets. They're the ones who invested in visibility before the crisis forced them to. They built systems to answer the question "what's in our code" when nothing was on fire, so they could answer it quickly when something was.

The ones who go dark might have reasonable explanations. Legacy systems. Resource constraints. Competing priorities. But that doesn't change what happens while you're waiting for confirmation on systems your operations depend on.

Four years after Log4j, if it happened again tomorrow—which of your vendors would respond in hours, and which ones would you still be waiting on a week later?

The answer to that question tells you something important about your actual risk exposure—something a SOC 2 report won't reveal.
