# The Persistent Channel

You approved that software three years ago. But that's not what's running on your systems today.

Every update since—every patch, every bug fix, every "minor version"—has been your vendor deploying new code into your environment. And most of it happened automatically, without review, without approval, without anyone noticing.

This is modern software delivery. And it's worth understanding what you've actually agreed to.

## The Channel You Didn't Know You Opened

When you install software, you're not just approving a product. You're opening a **permanent pathway** between your vendor and your systems.

Auto-updates mean your vendor can push code whenever they want. Most do—weekly, sometimes daily. Some security tools update **several times per day**. Each push is a deployment. Each deployment is a change you didn't review.

You approved version 2.0 three years ago. You're running version 2.4.187 now. Did anyone approve those 187 updates individually? Or did they just... happen?

We've covered how software gets delivered—the mechanisms vendors use to push updates to your environment. But there's a prior question: did you realize those mechanisms exist? Did you understand that installing software means opening a channel that never closes?

## SaaS Makes It Invisible

On-premise software at least has a version number you can point to. You can look at what's installed and know what you're running, even if you didn't approve every update along the way.

SaaS doesn't give you that.

Every time you log into a browser-based application, you're getting whatever version the vendor deployed last. Could have been this morning. Could have been an hour ago. There's no version number displayed. There's no approval step. No change control window. No "we'll update during our maintenance period."

You're always on the latest version whether you evaluated it or not. Your vendor's deployment schedule is now your deployment schedule.

## What This Actually Means

Your risk assessment evaluated a point in time—the version that existed when you did due diligence. The components you assessed, the visibility you established—that was a snapshot.

But software delivery means continuous change. The attack surface isn't static. It evolves every time your vendor pushes an update. And for most organizations, that's happening constantly—invisibly—across dozens of products.

Here's a test: Ask your IT team what changed in your critical vendor software in the last 30 days. What specific updates were deployed? When? What did they contain?

If they can't answer—and most can't—that's not a knowledge gap. That's an unmanaged risk you didn't know you had.
