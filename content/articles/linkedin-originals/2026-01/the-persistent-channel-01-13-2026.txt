You approved that software three years ago. But that's not what's running on your systems today.

Every update since — every patch, every bug fix, every "minor version" — has been your vendor deploying new code into your environment. And most of it happened automatically.

This is modern software delivery. And it's worth understanding what you've actually agreed to.

🔴 The persistent channel

When you install software, you're not just approving a product. You're opening a permanent pathway between your vendor and your systems.

Auto-updates mean your vendor can push code whenever they want. Most do — weekly, sometimes daily. Each push is a deployment. Each deployment is a change you didn't review.

You approved version 2.0 three years ago. You're running version 2.4.187 now. Did anyone approve those 187 updates individually? Or did they just... happen?

⚠️ SaaS makes it invisible

On-premise software at least has a version number you can point to. SaaS doesn't even give you that.

Every time you log into a browser-based application, you're getting whatever version the vendor deployed last. Could have been this morning. Could have been an hour ago.

There's no approval step. No change control window. No "we'll update during our maintenance period." You're always on the latest version whether you evaluated it or not.

Your vendor's deployment schedule is now your deployment schedule.

📋 What this actually means

Your risk assessment evaluated a point in time — the version that existed when you did due diligence. But software delivery means continuous change.

The attack surface isn't static. It evolves every time your vendor pushes an update. And most organizations have no visibility into when those pushes happen or what they contain.


When was the last time you knew — actually knew — what changed in an update before it hit your environment?
