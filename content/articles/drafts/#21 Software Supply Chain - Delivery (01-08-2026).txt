Topic: Software Supply Chain - Delivery Mechanisms
Date: 01/08/2026

You can build perfect software. But if the way it reaches your systems is compromised, none of that matters.

Two names. Two different lessons.

SolarWinds (2020)

Attackers didn't hack into companies directly. They compromised SolarWinds' update process — the mechanism that pushes new versions to customers.

So when 18,000 organizations installed what looked like a routine software update, they were actually installing a backdoor. The software update itself was the attack.

Nobody questioned it. Why would they? It came from the vendor. It was signed. It was "trusted."

CrowdStrike (2024)

No hackers this time. Just a faulty update pushed to millions of machines simultaneously.

One bad file. One automated delivery system. 8.5 million devices crashed. Airlines grounded. Hospitals disrupted. $5+ billion in damages.

Same delivery mechanism. Different failure mode.

The common thread

Both incidents had nothing to do with whether the software was well-built. They had everything to do with how that software gets delivered.

Updates. Patches. New versions. The pipeline that moves code from vendor to your systems.

That pipeline is infrastructure. And most of us have never looked at it.

Where this is headed

We've talked about what's inside software — the components, the open source supply chain.

Next week: how software actually reaches you. The delivery mechanisms we trust implicitly but rarely examine.

Because the next SolarWinds or CrowdStrike won't look exactly the same. But it'll probably use the same door.


How much do you know about how your critical vendors push updates to your environment?
