Title: Software Supply Chain Composition
Date: 1/1/2026

Dell doesn't make their own processors. They buy them from Intel. They don't make their own graphics cards either — those come from Nvidia.

This is supply chain. Components sourced from specialized manufacturers, assembled into a final product. You already understand this.

Modern software works the same way. Your vendor didn't write every line of code in their application. They assembled it from pre-built components — open source libraries written by other developers.

This is normal. This is efficient. This is how virtually all software gets built today.

But here's where the analogy breaks down.

🔴 The accountability gap

Intel is a $200 billion company. They have contracts, warranties, legal liability, and a reputation to protect. When Dell sources a processor, there's a corporate entity on the other end with skin in the game.

That open source encryption library your vendor is using? It might be maintained by a single volunteer in their spare time. No contract. No SLA. No legal entity. No warranty.

If something breaks, there's no one to call.

⚠️ The complexity gap

A laptop has maybe a few dozen major components. Complex, sure — but countable.

A modern software application might pull in hundreds or even thousands of open source components. Each one written by different people, maintained on different schedules, with different levels of security rigor.

And each of those components might pull in other components. Layers on layers.

📋 Why this matters

Hardware supply chain risk is corporate. There are contracts, audits, quality standards, and legal recourse.

Software supply chain risk is structural. The dependencies exist whether anyone's managing them or not. The volunteers maintaining critical libraries don't answer to your vendor — and your vendor might not even know they're there.

This isn't a criticism. It's just the reality of how modern software gets built.

And it's a reality TPRM hasn't caught up to yet.


Does your due diligence account for the difference between these two supply chains — or does it assume they work the same way?
