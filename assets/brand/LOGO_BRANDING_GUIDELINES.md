## Business Name Considerations

### Options to Consider

Since this is a personal consulting business, you have several naming approaches:

#### Option 1: Personal Name
**Format:** `[Your Name] Consulting` or `[Your Name], Risk Management Consultant`
- **Pros:** Personal connection, builds individual brand, transparent
- **Cons:** Less scalable if you want to grow beyond solo practice
- **Examples:** "John Smith Consulting," "Sarah Johnson Risk Advisory"

#### Option 2: Descriptive Firm Name
**Format:** Describes what you do
- **Pros:** Clear positioning, SEO benefits, professional
- **Cons:** Can be generic, harder to differentiate
- **Examples:** "Third-Party Risk Advisors," "Scalable Risk Frameworks," "Catalyst Risk Consulting"

#### Option 3: Abstract/Conceptual Name
**Format:** Meaningful word or phrase
- **Pros:** Memorable, brandable, flexible
- **Cons:** Requires explanation, less immediately clear
- **Examples:** "Meridian Risk," "Cornerstone Advisory," "Vanguard Risk Partners"

#### Option 4: Hybrid Approach
**Format:** `[Name] + [Descriptor]`
- **Pros:** Best of both worlds
- **Cons:** Can be long
- **Examples:** "Smith Risk Management," "Johnson Advisory Group"

### Recommendation for This Phase
For now, I'll use **"[Your Name]"** as placeholder in mockups. You can decide on final business name separately. The logo design will work with any of these approaches.

## Logo Design Direction

### Logo Style: Modern Monogram + Wordmark

Given the Modern Professional design with conservative banking palette, I recommend a clean, modern logo with these characteristics:

#### Logo Type: Combination Mark
- **Icon/Symbol:** Modern monogram or abstract symbol
- **Wordmark:** Business name in Inter Bold
- **Lockup:** Icon left, text right (horizontal)

### Three Logo Concepts

---

## Concept 1: Geometric Monogram (Recommended)

### Visual Description
A geometric symbol combining:
- **Initials** (your initials or business initials) in a modern, architectural style
- **Form:** Overlapping or interlocking shapes suggesting structure and frameworks
- **Geometry:** Clean lines, 90° angles, suggesting stability and precision

### Design Elements
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                                         │
│   ╔══╗                                  │
│   ║  ║  Business Name                  │
│   ╚══╝  Risk Management                │
│                                         │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

- **Icon:** 32px × 32px square grid
- **Primary Color:** Navy `#1D3557`
- **Accent:** Medium Blue `#4A90E2` (for one element or overlap)
- **Style:** Bold geometric shapes, minimal detail
- **Concept:** Framework/structure represented through clean geometry

### Applications
- **Header:** Full logo (icon + wordmark)
- **Mobile:** Icon only
- **Favicon:** Icon simplified to 16px
- **Print:** Works at any size

**Pros:**
- Professional and modern
- Memorable geometric form
- Scales beautifully
- Works in single color or two-color

**Cons:**
- Requires custom design
- Needs to be carefully balanced

---

## Concept 2: Abstract Symbol

### Visual Description
An abstract mark representing:
- **Connected nodes** or **network** (representing third-party relationships)
- **Ascending steps** (representing scale)
- **Shield or protective form** (representing risk management)

### Design Elements
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                                         │
│    ∆∆∆   Business Name                 │
│    ∆∆∆   Risk Management               │
│                                         │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

- **Icon:** Simplified, iconic form
- **Style:** Clean lines, modern minimal
- **Colors:** Navy base with Medium Blue accent
- **Concept:** Visual metaphor for risk management/frameworks

### Applications
Same as Concept 1

**Pros:**
- Unique and memorable
- Communicates business purpose
- Modern and professional

**Cons:**
- May be too abstract
- Harder to execute perfectly
- Risk of looking generic if not done well

## Concept 3: Typographic Wordmark Only

### Visual Description
No icon - pure typography logo with distinctive styling

### Design Elements
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                                         │
│   BUSINESS NAME                         │
│   Risk Management Consulting            │
│                                         │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

- **Primary Text:** Business name in Inter Bold or custom font
- **Secondary Text:** "Risk Management Consulting" or tagline in lighter weight
- **Styling:** Letter-spacing adjustment, weight contrast
- **Color:** Navy with Medium Blue accent (one letter or word)
- **Concept:** Confidence through typography alone

### Applications
- **Header:** Full wordmark + tagline
- **Mobile:** Abbreviated or stacked vertically
- **Favicon:** First letter(s)
- **Print:** Highly versatile

**Pros:**
- Clean and minimal (aligns with Minimalist option)
- Easy to implement
- Timeless
- Professional and authoritative

**Cons:**
- Less distinctive without custom typography
- Harder to create memorable favicon
- No visual symbol to recognize

---

## My Recommendation: Concept 1 (Geometric Monogram)

### Why This Works Best

1. **Professional & Modern:** Geometric design signals precision and structure
2. **Memorable:** Distinct symbol creates brand recognition
3. **Scalable:** Works at all sizes and contexts
4. **Flexible:** Icon can stand alone or with wordmark
5. **Banking-Appropriate:** Conservative enough for banking industry
6. **Framework Metaphor:** Geometric structure echoes "frameworks that scale"

### Quick Implementation Path

If you don't have a graphic designer immediately:

**Temporary Logo Option:**
- Simple text logo with styled initials
- Uses Inter Bold for initials, Inter Medium for full name
- Navy and Medium Blue color split
- Example: **JD** Johnson & Davies Risk Management

**Long-term:**
- Commission custom geometric monogram design
- Professional designer can create polished version
- Budget: $300-1000 for quality logo design

## Temporary Logo for Development

### Quick Start Option

While you decide on final branding, use this simple approach:

```html
<div class="logo">
  <span class="logo-icon">[YI]</span>
  <span class="logo-text">Your Name</span>
</div>
```

**Styling:**
- Icon: Navy square with Medium Blue initials
- Text: Inter Bold, Navy
- Simple and professional for mockups

### CSS Example
```css
.logo-icon {
  display: inline-block;
  width: 32px;
  height: 32px;
  background: #1D3557;
  color: #4A90E2;
  font-family: Inter, sans-serif;
  font-weight: 700;
  font-size: 16px;
  text-align: center;
  line-height: 32px;
  border-radius: 2px;
}
```

This gives you a functional logo while you work on final design.

## Logo Don'ts

### What to Avoid

❌ Don't use different colors not in brand palette
❌ Don't distort or stretch the logo
❌ Don't add effects (drop shadows, gradients, glows)
❌ Don't place logo on busy backgrounds
❌ Don't use low-resolution raster files when vector available
❌ Don't alter spacing between icon and wordmark
❌ Don't change the font
❌ Don't place logo too close to edges (respect clear space)

## Next Steps

### Logo Development Path

1. **Decide on business name** (personal vs. firm name)
2. **Choose logo concept** (Geometric, Abstract, or Typographic)
3. **DIY or hire designer:**
