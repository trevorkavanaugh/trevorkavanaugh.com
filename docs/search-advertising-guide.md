# Search Advertising Guide for TPRM Thought Leadership

## Overview

This guide prepares you to launch search advertising to capture traffic when your GARP feature goes live. The goal is to be discoverable when people search for TPRM topics and your name.

---

## Platform Strategy

### Start With: Google Ads
- ~90% of search traffic
- Most robust targeting and analytics
- Essential for visibility

### Add Later: Microsoft Ads (Bing)
- ~5% market share BUT valuable for your audience
- Corporate Windows users often have Bing as default (banking employees)
- Older, professional demographic
- 30-50% lower cost-per-click than Google
- **Easy import:** Microsoft has one-click campaign import from Google

**Recommendation:** Get Google running smoothly first (1-2 weeks), then import to Microsoft.

## Campaign Structure

### Campaign 1: Brand Terms (Highest Priority)
**Purpose:** Capture people searching for you by name

**Keywords:**
- trevor kavanaugh
- trevor kavanaugh tprm
- trevor kavanaugh third party risk
- trevor kavanaugh garp

**Match Type:** Phrase match or exact match

**Why This Matters:** When GARP features you, people will Google your name. You want to own that search result, not let LinkedIn or random pages rank above your site.

**Budget:** $5-10/day (low volume but high intent)

---

### Campaign 2: Topic Terms (Discovery)
**Purpose:** Reach people researching TPRM topics you write about

**Keywords:**
```
third party risk management
tprm best practices
vendor risk management banking
fourth party risk
software supply chain risk
vendor concentration risk
tprm framework
third party risk assessment
```

**Match Type:** Phrase match (broader reach with some control)

**Negative Keywords (exclude these):**
```
jobs
salary
certification
course
training
software (unless paired with "risk")
template free
```

**Why Negative Keywords:** You don't want clicks from job seekers or people looking for free templates. They won't convert to meaningful connections.

**Budget:** $15-20/day

---

### Campaign 3: Research Paper (When Published)
**Purpose:** Promote "The Collective Fragility Paradox"

**Keywords:**
```
software supply chain risk whitepaper
tprm research paper
collective fragility
vendor dependency risk
crowdstrike incident analysis
log4j supply chain risk
```

**Landing Page:** Direct to research paper page

**Budget:** $5-10/day

---

## Ad Copy Best Practices

### Structure
```
Headline 1 (30 chars): Primary hook
Headline 2 (30 chars): Credibility/differentiator
Headline 3 (30 chars): Call to action
Description (90 chars): Value proposition
```

### Example Ads

**Brand Campaign:**
```
Headline 1: Trevor Kavanaugh | TPRM
Headline 2: VP, Third-Party Risk Management
Headline 3: Insights & Research
Description: Practical perspectives on vendor risk, software supply chains, and building programs that work. Read the latest insights.
```

**Topic Campaign:**
```
Headline 1: Third-Party Risk Insights
Headline 2: From a Banking TPRM Leader
Headline 3: Read Expert Perspectives
Description: Cut through the noise. Practical TPRM guidance from someone who builds and runs vendor risk programs. No theory—real experience.
```

**Research Paper Campaign:**
```
Headline 1: The Collective Fragility Paradox
Headline 2: TPRM Research Paper
Headline 3: Free Download
Description: How rational vendor decisions create systemic fragility. 12 chapters analyzing Log4j, CrowdStrike, MOVEit & more.
```

### Tips
- Use your actual title (VP, Third-Party Risk Management) — credibility matters
- Avoid generic phrases ("best in class", "leading expert")
- Be specific about what they'll get (insights, research, perspectives)
- Match ad copy to landing page content

## Targeting Settings

### Location
- United States (primary)
- Consider: Canada, UK, Australia if budget allows

### Language
- English

### Audience Segments (Optional Enhancement)
Google allows layering audience targeting:
- Financial Services industry
- Banking professionals
- Risk Management interests
- Business decision makers

**Note:** Use "Observation" mode first (bid adjustment) not "Targeting" mode (restriction). This lets you see which audiences perform without limiting reach.

### Device
- All devices (desktop, mobile, tablet)
- Consider increasing bids on desktop (professionals searching at work)

### Schedule
- Weekdays 7am-7pm (when professionals are searching)
- Or run 24/7 and let data guide optimization

## Budget Guidelines

### Minimum Viable Budget
- $10/day = ~$300/month
- Enough for brand protection + light topic coverage

### Recommended Starting Budget
- $20-25/day = ~$600-750/month
- Covers brand + topic campaigns with room to learn

### What to Expect
- Average CPC for TPRM terms: $3-8
- At $20/day, expect 3-7 clicks per day
- Focus on quality (right audience) over quantity

### Cost Control
- Set daily budget caps (Google respects these)
- Start with manual CPC bidding for control
- Move to automated bidding once you have conversion data

## Conversion Tracking

### What to Track
1. **Contact form submissions** — Highest value
2. **LinkedIn profile clicks** — Connection intent
3. **Email link clicks** — Direct outreach intent
4. **Research paper downloads** — Lead capture
5. **Time on site >2 minutes** — Engaged visitors

### How to Set Up
1. Google Ads > Tools > Conversions
2. Create conversion action for each goal
3. Add tracking code to thank you pages or use Google Tag Manager
4. Import goals from Google Analytics 4

### Why This Matters
Without conversion tracking, you're flying blind. You need to know which keywords and ads drive actual engagement, not just clicks.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. Broad Match Keywords Without Negatives
Broad match "third party risk" will show your ads for "third party car insurance" and waste budget. Use phrase match and build negative keyword lists.

### 2. Sending All Traffic to Homepage
Create specific landing pages or use deep links. Someone searching "software supply chain risk" should land on your supply chain article, not your homepage.

### 3. Ignoring Search Terms Report
Check what actual searches triggered your ads. You'll find irrelevant terms to exclude and valuable terms to add.

### 4. Set and Forget
Search advertising needs ongoing attention. Budget 15 minutes weekly minimum.

### 5. Expecting Immediate ROI
Thought leadership advertising builds awareness over time. Track engagement metrics (time on site, pages viewed) not just conversions. The goal is being discoverable when someone researches you after seeing your GARP feature.

2. Go to Import > Import from Google Ads
