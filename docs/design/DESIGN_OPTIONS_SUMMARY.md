## My Recommendation

Based on the business positioning ("Building Risk Management Frameworks That Scale") and target market (banks seeking specialized, independent expertise), I recommend **Option 2: Modern Professional** for the following reasons:

1. **Differentiation:** Stands out from both Big 4 firms (too corporate) and generic consultants (too casual)

2. **Target Alignment:** Appeals to mid-size banks and credit unions that value modern approaches while maintaining professional standards

3. **Visual Hierarchy:** Strategic use of coral accent guides attention to CTAs and key information

4. **Credibility Balance:** Professional enough for banking industry, modern enough to show innovation

5. **Scalability Message:** The contemporary design supports the "frameworks that scale" positioning better than conservative or ultra-minimal approaches

**However**, if your target clients are primarily large, highly conservative institutions, Option 1 would be safer. If you want maximum simplicity and a purely expertise-driven presence, Option 3 is excellent.

## Next Steps

1. **Review** all three options
2. **Consider** which aligns with:
   - Your personal brand/style
   - Target client preferences
   - Competitive positioning
   - Long-term vision
3. **Select** one option (or hybrid elements)
4. **Refine** selected design with specific content
5. **Prototype** homepage in HTML/CSS
6. **Test** with target audience if possible
7. **Implement** full site

---

## Hybrid Approach

You can also combine elements from different options:

**Example Hybrid:**
- Color palette from Option 1 (navy, grey, tan)
- Layout structure from Option 2 (asymmetric hero, numbered services)
- Whitespace philosophy from Option 3 (generous spacing, clean)

This would create a professional, modern site with traditional banking colors and excellent readability.
